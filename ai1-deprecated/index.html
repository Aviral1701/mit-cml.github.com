  The system at this web site is App Inventor Classic. App Inventor Classic is now obsolete. 
</p>
<p>If you are creating new apps, or running classes with App Inventor,
  you should switch to App Inventor 2, which is available at
  http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu.
</p>

<p>Apps built with App Inventor Classic continue to run, in general, and projects can still be edited and
created on the App Inventor Classic Web site. But some older App Inventor Classic apps already cannot run on newer Android devices, and the frequency of this might increase with continued changes in Android and Java. As of now, you can fix such an old app by rebuilding it on the App Inventor Classic web site.
</p>

<p>MIT is continuing to run this App Inventor Classic server, but we will not be fixing bugs or responding to requests
for new features. We have not set a date for closing down the App Inventor Classic service,
and we have no plans to do this before summer 2015. On the other hand, continued changes to Java by Oracle
may make it increasingly awkward, or even impossible, to use App Inventor Classic, and MIT has no control over these changes.
</p>

<p>
Projects downloaded from App Inventor 1 cannot be loaded in App Inventor 2.
MIT plans to provide a tool to help transfer projects from App Inventor 1 to App Inventor 2,
but it won't be available before summer 2015. Even when it is available,
it won't produce a complete automatic translation: You'll probably need to do some hand modification
to the result of the tool.
