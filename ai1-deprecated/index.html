  The system at this web site is App Inventor Classic. App Inventor Classic is now obsolete.

<p><b>App Inventor Classic IS SHUTTING DOWN on July 15,
    2015.</b> <a href="shutdown.html" target="_blank">Important
    Information, Please Read</a></p>
<p>If you are creating new apps, or running classes with App Inventor,
  you should switch to App Inventor 2, which is available at
  http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu.
</p>
<p>
Projects downloaded from App Inventor 1 cannot be loaded in App Inventor 2.
MIT plans to provide a tool to help transfer projects from App Inventor 1 to App Inventor 2,
but it won't be available before summer 2015. Even when it is available,
it won't produce a complete automatic translation: You'll probably need to do some hand modification
to the result of the tool.
