<p>
  The system at this web site is App Inventor Classic.
</p>
<p>If you are creating new apps, or running classes with App Inventor,
  you should switch to App Inventor 2, which is available at
  http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu.
</p>
<p>
  The App Inventor team will begin deprecating the App Inventor
  Classic system sometime this fall.  Before that, we will provide a
  tool that will provide help in translating existing App Inventor
  projects to App Inventor 2.  But if you are starting new projects,
  you should start them with App Inventor 2.
