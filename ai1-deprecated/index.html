    Information, Please Read</a></p>
<p>If you are creating new apps, or running classes with App Inventor,
  you should switch to App Inventor 2, which is available at
  <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu" target="_blank">http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
Projects downloaded from App Inventor 1 cannot be loaded in App Inventor 2.
MIT has provided a converter tool to help transfer projects from App Inventor 1 to App Inventor 2.
This converter is available at <a href="http://convert.appinventor.mit.edu">http://convert.appinventor.mit.edu</a>
</p>
<p>
The converter won't produce a complete automatic translation: You'll probably need to do some hand modification
to the result of the conversion.
