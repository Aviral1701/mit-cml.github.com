 <title>2014 Technovation Challenge reaches 3500 young women</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2014/05/2014</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;From February to May of 2014, 3,500 young women from ages 10 to 23 spanning 45 countries around the globe signed up to create mobile apps to solve problems in their communities. They built prototypes using MIT App Inventor, wrote business plans, and pitched their mobile app &quot;startups&quot; to judges via YouTube, in competition for a trip to Silicon Vallley and part of $20,000 in seed funding. Over 12 weeks, the students worked closely with their teachers and mentors and ultimately delivered 350 app submissions. On June 18th, 2014, 10 finalist teams will pitch their apps at the World Pitch event at Intel Headquarters. Find out more at technovationchallenge.org&lt;/p&gt;

 <title> Shay Pokress to join Project Lead the Way</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2014/04/shay</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m writing with bittersweet emotion to announce that Shaileen (Shay) Pokress, our MIT App Inventor Director of Education, will be leaving MIT at the beginning of May to take up a position as Director of Computer Science Instruction for Project Lead The Way. Project Lead the Way is one of the country&#039;s top providers of STEM educational programs, with curriculum used in more than 5000 schools. Shay will initially focus on computing curriculum for middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shay has been the face of MIT App Inventor to the K-12 educational community from almost the day the project moved from Google to MIT. Those of you working with App Inventor in schools and teacher communities know what a terrific force Shay&#039;s been in emphasizing the potential for kids to be creators of mobile technology. Most recently, she led the re-purposing in December of MIT&#039;s App Inventor curriculum for the launch of App Inventor 2 and the subsequent outreach over the past four months, a period during which one and a half million new apps were started using App Inventor, and the number of regular weekly users of our MIT site grew from 60,000 to 85,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shay&#039;s achievements at MIT App Inventor will a hard act to follow:  we&#039;ll miss her insight, her energy, and her enthusiasm. At the same time, we&#039;re happy that she&#039;s moving into a position where she can have such larger impact on emerging K-12 school computer science education, and we&#039;re looking forward to her carrying the values of App Inventor and the Center for Mobile Learning to a new, larger sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Hal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Announcing the Bug finding contest winners</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2014/01/announcing-bug-finding-contest-winners</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It’s with pleasure that I can announce the results of December’s App Inventor Bug Finding contest.   The results were so strong that we decided to award two first-place prizes.  The winners are Arjun Santhoshkumar and Taifun Bär.  Arjun and Taifun worked hard to ferret out bugs, and they each identified several that were important to the MIT team in our launch of App Inventor 2.  Each of them will be receiving a Nexus 5 Android Smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re tremendously pleased with the results of the bugs contest.  This is a tribute to the care and enthusiasm of the App Inventor  community as we migrate from App Inventor Classic to App Inventor 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Arjun and Taifun, there are 10 second-place winners and 7 third-place winners.   Each second-place winner will received .... and each third-place winner will receive ....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to all the winners, and thanks to everyone who participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the MIT App Inventor Team,&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>H***app***y New Year</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2013/12/happy-new-year</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Happy New Year! Thanks you for your support for App Inventor and for your participation on these forums.  We at MIT have closed out a great year:  We met our major goal of launching App Inventor 2 before the end of 2013, and we&amp;#039;re eagerly watching usage grow.  More than 100,000 people have signed on to App Inventor 2 since we launched it at the beginning of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Inventor Classic is no slouch either, which more than a million users.  We&amp;#039;ll be keeping Classic running through the school year in the spring, to accommodate classes that are using it this year.   We expect that people who are now starting out with App Inventor will start with AI2, and that people using Classic will migrate to AI2 over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this key milestone passed, we&amp;#039;re looking forward to an even greater 2014, with more curriculum, more classes, more apps competitions, and more enthusiastic people like you who are experiencing the fun and fulfillment of creating your own mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#039;s to doing that together,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the MIT App Inventor Team,&lt;br /&gt;
Hal Abelson&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Christmas Gift: Merry Christmas and H*app*y Holidays</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2013/12/christmas-gift-merry-christmas-and-happy-holidays</link>

It lets anyone create Christmas cards by filling in a form: you can include your own pictures and videos and you can send the card to your friends and family.  Even better, it lets them create and send their own cards in turn.   Yo Yo Fun was built with App Inventor 2.   It’s an example of the kinds of things you can do in App Inventor, by combining the fun of creating mobile apps with the power of the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>The New App Inventor is Coming:  Hunt bugs in App Inventor 2 and win prizes!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2013/11/new-app-inventor-coming-hunt-bugs-app-inventor-2-and-win-prizes</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added December 3:  Thank you!  The contest is over and there were lots of great entries.   We&#039;ll try to announce the winners next week.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re continuing to make progress on the launch of the new App Inventor system (pre-release name is App Inventor 2), where the entire system runs in the browser (no more downloading of the blocks editor Java application).    We’re still on track to release it before the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who have been using App Inventor 2, and helping us test -- a big thank you!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who are still using App Inventor 1, we will keep the App Inventor 1 running as it is through the spring (and maybe longer).   But you might want to experiment with App Inventor 2 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;.  Keep in mind that projects currently cannot be transferred between App Inventor 1 and App Inventor 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re now at the point in our App Inventor 2 development where we need lots of testing.   So we’re holding a contest and inviting you to submit bug reports for a chance at a prize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    The first prize is a Nexus 5 phone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be awarding 10 second prizes and 20 third prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter, submit a report describing a bug in App Inventor 2 &lt;ai2.appinventor.mit.edu&gt;. The bug can be for MacOS, Windows, or GNU/Linux, but it must be for MIT App Inventor 2. Judging will be by the MIT App Inventor Team.   Here are some of the criteria we’ll be using:&lt;/ai2.appinventor.mit.edu&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this a real bug in App Inventor, as opposed to a problem with an individual program or a request for a new feature?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this a new bug, or something that has been already been reported on the forum?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this an important bug?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the bug report well-written, with clear instructions for how we can verify it and duplicate it?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the bug concern one of our preferred areas of emphasis (see below)?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadline for entries is one minute after midnight 12:01AM Eastern Standard Time on December 2, 2013.  You can start bug hunting now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter, you must complete both steps below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fill out the Report an Issue form on the App Inventor 2 page.   In the blank that asks you to describe the issue, write “Contest Entry” followed by a brief description of the bug.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Send email to   &lt;span id=&quot;7fcabfe4911afec8b5b8fd80ef54fc7b1cfad1d3&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
&lt;!--//--&gt;&lt;![CDATA[// &gt;&lt;!--
 &lt;!--
  document.getElementById(&#039;7fcabfe4911afec8b5b8fd80ef54fc7b1cfad1d3&#039;).innerHTML = &#039;&lt;a href=&quot;&amp;#109;&amp;#97;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#58;&amp;#97;&amp;#112;&amp;#112;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#46;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&quot;&gt;&amp;#97;&amp;#112;&amp;#112;&amp;#105;&amp;#110;&amp;#118;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;&amp;#114;&amp;#99;&amp;#111;&amp;#110;&amp;#116;&amp;#101;&amp;#115;&amp;#116;&amp;#64;&amp;#109;&amp;#105;&amp;#116;&amp;#46;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#117;&#039;;
// --&gt; 
//--&gt;&lt;!]]&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;&lt;p&gt;, with a full description of the bug.  If you want to attach a project file that demonstrates the bug (highly recommended) attach it here.    Make sure to send the email from the same address you filled in on the form in step 1.  Also make the subject line of the email be the issue  (or the first few words of the issue) that you specified on the form.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can enter as many times as you like, but we’ll award at most one prize per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H*app*y Bug Hunting&lt;br /&gt;
The MIT App Inventor Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of Emphasis&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to consider bug reports about any aspect of App Inventor 2, but we will give special consideration to bugs that concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;large programs, that may exceed the timing or storage limitations of App Inventor (please attach aia files for these)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the AI setup packages or the AI Companion
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;apps with multiple screens
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bad documentation (typos, dead links, wrong information)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Please help up test the new site for sharing App Inventor projects</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/please-help-test-new-site-sharing-app-inventor-projects</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since App Inventor was launched, there have been many requests  for a site where people can exhibit and share their App Inventor  work.   MIT and  University of Massachusetts at  Lowell are collaborating on creating such a Gallery site, which  we hope to launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, we are looking for volunteer testers to provide  feedback on the site and to help shake it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the App Inventor service was released from MIT, and before that  from Google, our testers were essential in getting the system  launched.   And the same will be true for this Gallery.   So we&#039;re  forward to your active -- and critically important -- participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For details, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/appinventor/2t7v0svkCq0&quot;&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; by Prof. Martin of UMass Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can  sign up to be a tester by completing the form at&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Announcing:  MIT App Inventor  Open Beta Preview</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/announcing-mit-app-inventor-open-beta-preview</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT Center for Mobile Learning is delighted to announce that we’re meeting our goal of making MIT App Inventor available as a public service in the first quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past two months, we have been conducting a closed test of the system for an increasing number of testers, and we’ve currently scaled to 5000 testers.   Today, we’re taking the next step, and opening the MIT App Inventor service to everyone.   All you will need is a Google ID for log-in (for example, a Gmail account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Inventor will now be suitable for any use, including running classes. But please be aware that this is the first time the system will be under load from a large number of users, so there may be bumps and adjustments as the load increases.   For now, we suggest that you maintain backup copies of important apps, as we see how things go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are glitches and minor errors and lots of room for improvement.  We’ll be turning our attention to these improvements, once we have more experience with running the system at scale. We will also be developing more resources and support for using App Inventor as a learning tool. We look forward to working with you over the coming months to build the community of App Inventor educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We owe a large debt to our testers of the past few months; it’s been their feedback that’s given us the confidence for today’s announcement.   And we’re tremendously grateful to the folks who have been running their own system with the MIT JAR files.  Their experiences have been an invaluable source of information, and their work has been critical in keeping App Inventor alive while the MIT service was not yet available.    We also want to acknowledge the growing group of developers who are starting to explore the App Inventor source code.   They are the seeds of an open source community that we hope will take App Inventor beyond anything we could do by ourselves at MIT.   And our extreme gratitude and admiration goes to the Google App Inventor team who, even while their project transitions out of Google, have continued to share their expertise and the fruit of their hard work of the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join with us in helping the system move to its next phase as an MIT service.   You can learn about MIT App Inventor by visiting our new home at &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;http://appinventor.mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>MIT App Inventor mid-January status update</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/mit-app-inventor-mid-january-status-update</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s been three months since we started work on App Inventor at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning and three weeks since Google&#039;s public service went offline.  Here&#039;s brief progress report on the replacement public service we&#039;ll be deploying at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far (knock on wood) our development effort is on track for releasing the MIT Public App Inventor Service in the first quarter of this year.  While unexpected issues can always arise, we&#039;re guardedly optimistic that people who plan to run App Inventor courses or workshops can anticipate being able to use the MIT service by mid-April.  But please check the postings at this site about the status of the public server before you make firm commitments.  Remember that, as a backup, you can run your own App Inventor server using our JAR files as described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some other developments and things we’re working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some users of Google App Inventor didn&#039;t notice the warning that they would need to download their projects in order to preserve them after the shutdown of the Google service, and there have been several cries for help from distraught users.  Though some last-minute heroics, the Google App Inventor team was able to package up everyone&#039;s projects and store them in a zip file in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; account.  Google can&#039;t guarantee that all projects survived, but at least 95% of them did.  So if you didn&#039;t download your projects in time, check your Docs files; and give some thanks to the Google team for making the extra effort to do this at a really busy time during the transition to MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at MIT, testing with the MIT experimental service is going well.  We&#039;ve just admitted 300 more testers, making 700 testers in all, and there&#039;s a long waiting list.  To get on the waiting list, read the information at &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/developers-blogs/hal/2011/dec/help-test-mit-prototype-app-inventor-service&quot;&gt;Help test the MIT prototype service&lt;/a&gt; and fill out the form.  We&#039;ll work through the waiting list as fast as the service becomes stable enough to handle the load. Our work at MIT over the past two weeks has focused on improving the “build server” that packages apps for the phone, and we&#039;ll be watching that carefully over the coming weeks as we add more testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fappinventoredu.mit.edu%2Fdevelopers-blogs%2Fandrew%2F2011%2Fnov%2Frunning-your-own-app-inventor-service&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGPw1T_JUk2MLJzAdqk0E5IhC9Fmw&quot;&gt;Java Archive (JAR) distribution&lt;/a&gt;, which lets people set up their own small-scale App Inventor services, is also in good shape.  There&#039;s a lot of use by individuals and also by classes: the JARs are our temporary solution for people who need to run classes before the MIT Public Service becomes available.  One issue that has surfaced with the JARs is that, when there are more than a few students, App Inventor daily usage can out run Google App Engine&#039;s quota on free service.  If you&#039;re in that situation, try turning on App Engine billing for a day and seeing how high your load is.  People who have done that report that the App Engine cost turns out to be a couple of dollars per week, something that should be tolerable until the free MIT service comes online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers and hobbyists, the big news this week is that Google has just released the App Inventor code as Free and Open Source Software, as described &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fappinventoredu.mit.edu%2Fdevelopers-blogs%2Fhal%2F2012%2Fjan%2Fgoogle-and-mit-announce-open-sourcing-app-inventor-code&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFOKt0orpiWvUxjYFQAJaTkZjzDBA&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  We hope to nurture a rich open-source community from MIT, but we won&#039;t start doing that until our public service is running.  For now, we’ll leave it everyone is free to experiment with the code as they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, three weeks into our projected three-month transition period, we&#039;re on track.  If we make our goal smoothly, it will be with enormous gratitude to Google: to Google Research for providing the funding to create the Center for Mobile Learning, and to the Google App Inventor Team for a simply monumental effort last fall to port App Inventor to the open-source implementation, that we are now finishing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
