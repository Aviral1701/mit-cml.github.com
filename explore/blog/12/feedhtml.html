 <title>New Release brings exciting new functionality!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/%5Byyyy%5D/%5Bmon%5D/new-release-brings-exciting-new-functionality</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing the newest App Inventor release!&lt;br /&gt;
Version 129 is now live. In addition to a few bug fixes and minor User Interface improvements, here are the exciting new features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resize-able and Full Screen Video support&lt;/strong&gt;. You can now resize an existing Video Player component from the blocks editor. In Android 2.0+ you can set a Video Player to use the entire phone&#039;s screen. The &lt;back&gt; key will restore it to its original size. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/videowall.html&quot;&gt;VideoWall tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start to check this out!&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal and Vertical Arrangements can now align their contents&lt;/strong&gt;. Arrangements and Screens can now align their contents along Left, Right, Center, Top and Bottom edges.&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: These settings have no effect if the arrangement size is set to automatic. The vertical setting has no effect if the screen is scrollable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canvas and Sprite Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;. The new events &quot;Flung&quot;, &quot;TouchUP&quot; and &quot;TouchDown&quot; have been added to Sprites and Canvases.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flung:&lt;/strong&gt; When a user touches a Sprite and then quickly swipes their finger in some direction, a &quot;Flung&quot; event is issued for the Sprite which gives the direction and speed of the swipe. This can be used to determine the direction and relative speed to move a Sprite. Canvases also receive a Flung event so a user can perform the swiping (Fling) motion anywhere on a Canvas and the MIT App Inventor programmer can decide how to handle it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TouchDown/TouchUp:&lt;/strong&gt; When a user places their finger on a Sprite, a TouchDown event is now triggered. When they lift their finger a TouchUP event is triggered. These events are in addition to the existing &quot;Touched&quot; event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New screen orientation settings:&lt;/strong&gt; (1) User (let&#039;s the app&#039;s user select portrait or landscape; and (2) Sensor (auto-rotates as the phone rotates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tutorials corresponding to these new features are coming soon so stay tuned. H*app*y Inventing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Ed Week features App Inventor as tool for engaging students</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/ed-week-features-app-inventor-tool-engaging-students</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check it out: Ed Week ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&quot;&gt;feature article on App Inventor&lt;/a&gt; and the power of teaching students how to build mobile apps. Many excellent programs are described in the article, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthapplab.com/&quot;&gt;Youth APPLab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iridescentlearning.org/programs/technovation-challenge/&quot;&gt;Technovation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthradio.org/&quot;&gt;Youth Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and others. My favorite quote is from an eighth grade girl: &quot;These programs expand your view on careers like computer science and engineering and show the fun in them.&quot; This is what we are all about at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning!&lt;br /&gt;
Read the article here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&quot;&gt;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Welcome to the new App Inventor website!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/welcome-new-app-inventor-website</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello again,&lt;br /&gt;
After a bit of a hiatus, this blog is back in action. I was waiting to post a new entry until we had successfully rolled out the NEW WEBSITE! Now that it&#039;s here, I&#039;d like to draw your attention to a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor website hosted at MIT (appinventor.mit.edu) is actually three separate sites: the &quot;explore&quot; site, the &quot;teach&quot; site, and the &quot;service&quot; site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C95828&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;service site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the site you already know and love as it hosts the actual App Inventor software where you build your own app projects. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#9AAE47&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;explore site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is geared toward the casual visitor as well as the veteran app builder. We will post news, project updates, stories about people using App Inventor, and things of that nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://teach.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#73B3DF&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;teach site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or educators&#039; site, is an oasis of information and support for people who are using App Inventor with students -- of any age and in any setting. This is the area where I will be focusing much of my energy over the next several months, as we build this site to include more education materials, and as we build the community by engaging people in joining in the exchange of ideas around App Inventor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is valued and welcome! Please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; your thoughts and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&#039;d like to let you know about the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Invitational&lt;/em&gt; App Inventor Summit on July 13/14 in Cambridge, MA. This meeting is intended to set the agenda for the App Inventor project for the next year. For more information, and to see how you can apply to participate, see the &lt;a href=&quot;../summit&quot;&gt;Summit Information page&lt;/a&gt;. Applications close June 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s all for now. Happy inventing...&lt;br /&gt;
Shay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>App Inventor helping to bridge gap in numbers of CS Majors</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/app-inventor-helping-bridge-gap-numbers-cs-majors</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Inventors,  One of our main goals at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning is to encourage greater participation in computing from a wider and more varied assortment of people. App Inventor does this by inherently fostering personal creativity with technology. I was pleased to see App Inventor mentioned in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&quot;&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Maggie Johnson, Google&#039;s Director of Education, in which she writes about the resurgence of CS Education: &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&quot;&gt;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&lt;/a&gt;  little by little...&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Hog Wild for App Inventor!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/hog-wild-app-inventor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello App Inventors, Things are moving right along here at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning. The community continues to grow and we have now topped the 90,000 mark for the number unique accounts on the App Inventor service! We have several initiatives underway to bring you new materials and learning opportunities. Stay tuned to this blog and to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum/index.html&quot;&gt;Educators&#039; forum&lt;/a&gt; for updates.  Today I&#039;d like to share an entertaining story... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;A science lab doesn&#039;t need to have a ceiling... a science lab doesn&#039;t even need to have walls!&quot;...&lt;/em&gt; Gina Hall McCarley, an Alabama high school teacher, shared a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories/wild-hogs-app&quot;&gt;story highlighting the usefulness of App Inventor as a tool for science exploration&lt;/a&gt;: tracking wildlife in a local forest. Using App Inventor, students programmed a simple data collection tool for documenting wild hog populations, to help scientists better understand a local environmental issue that has real-world implications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories?page=1&quot;&gt;Read more on the App Inventor stories pages&lt;/a&gt;, share these stories with other educators, and become inspired to help students create their own mobile tools for deepening learning across the curriculum.  Do you have a story to share? &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/contact&quot;&gt;Send it to us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/app-inventor-community-continues-grow</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello App Inventor Educators! My name is Shaileen Pokress (“Shay”). I have just gotten started in my new position as Education Community Manager at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning. I am working with the App Inventor Team to facilitate sharing of ideas and materials in support of using App Inventor for learning. Whether you’re involved in informal settings or are using App Inventor in the classroom, I invite you to join with us as we build this community of educators.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/developers-blogs/hal/2012/mar/announcing-mit-app-inventor-open-beta-preview&quot;&gt;App Inventor was re-launched by MIT&lt;/a&gt; just two weeks ago, and already over 70,000 unique users have registered! We anticipate a great deal of activity over the coming months as this community begins to take advantage of this powerful tool for engaging learners in tinkering with technology.  That’s all for now. Sign up for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum/index.html&quot;&gt;App Inventor Educators’ Google Group&lt;/a&gt; to join our ongoing discussion.  -- Shay Pokress&lt;/p&gt;
