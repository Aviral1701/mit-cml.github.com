 <title>MIT CML at Mobile World Congress</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2013/03/mit-cml-mobile-world-congress</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leo Burd and I have recovered from jetlag and are ready to report on our trip to the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona February 25-28. We went to MWC to represent the MIT Center for Mobile Learning as part of the unX network, a partnership with CSEV, UNED, Telefónica, and Banco Santander that is creating the first learning and entrepreneurship portal for Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MWC conference was HUGE! Over 70,000 people attended from all over the world, and representing every branch of industry related to mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found our niche in the Spain Pavilion, where many people stopped to hear about unX and App Inventor. Leo Burd was part of a presentation about the success of unX, along with several other key players including Mr. Victor Calvo-Sotelo, the Spanish Secretary of State for Telecommunications, and Mr. Cesar Alierta, President of Telefónica Group. During the presentation, we officially announced that unX was now available in both Portuguese and Spanish for anyone to join in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/Leo_speaking.jpeg&quot; syle=&quot;float:left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the presentation was going on in the Spanish pavilion, I (Shaileen Pokress) was busy giving a talk to a packed room as part of the mEducation panel. There was overwhelming interest in the topic of mobile technology for education, as evidenced by the extremely long line outside the door (most were turned away due to lack of space.) I&#039;m certain that MWC will provide a larger space at next year&#039;s conference for this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/mwc_panel_sm.jpg&quot; syle=&quot;float:left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenters and panelists at the mEducation session were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graham Brown-Martin, Education Design Labs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peggy Johnson, Qualcomm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Held, Etisalat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florence Gaudry-Perkins, Alcatel-Lucent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanessa Lucio, Telefonica Learning Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaileen Pokress,MIT Center for Mobile Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We each had a different take on what &quot;mobile education&quot; means, and how mobile technologies can change the landscape of schooling. While most of the points made by my co-presenters had to do with educational content for mobile devices, I made sure to emphasize that the Center for Mobile Learning aims to provide ways for students to create their own mobile learning tools and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this post has gotten longer than I&#039;d intended. Up next... SIGCSE 2013. App Inventor was well represented, and our team made it home despite the snow storm! Stay tuned...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>NEW RELEASE brings sprite flinging, wifi texting, and more!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2012/11/new-release-brings-sprite-flinging-wifi-texting-and-more</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have great news: the new release of App Inventor is now live, and contains some exciting new functionality. Be sure to read the &lt;a href=&quot;//beta.appinventor.mit.edu/ReleaseNotes.html&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; for the entire list of updates. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprites and Canvas can now respond to &lt;b&gt;Fling, TouchDown, and TouchUp gestures&lt;/b&gt;. This offers a lot of potential for new games and interactive apps! Try out the &lt;a href=&quot;//appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/minigolf.html&quot;&gt;Mini Golf tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that shows you how to build a fun app that takes advantage of these new gesture events. The tutorial also offers a nice example for setting up screen components dynamically so that they look great on any size screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for &lt;b&gt;Google Fusion Tables&lt;/b&gt; has been updated. You can now build apps that read and write to a Google Fusion Table, providing a powerful data sharing solution. See the new &lt;a href=&quot;//appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/pizzaparty.html&quot;&gt;Pizza Party tutorial for a how-to guide on creating fusion tables&lt;/a&gt; and connecting to them through App Inventor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Texting is now enabled over wifi&lt;/b&gt; for phones without cell service (no SIM card)! While the traditional SMS texting over a cell phone provider still works just fine, this new capability allows you to connect to your &lt;b&gt;Google Voice account&lt;/b&gt; so that texts can be sent and received on devices that are only connected through wifi. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/google-voice&quot;&gt;How To Guide to Wifi Texting with App Inventor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The packaging process now uses the &lt;b&gt;zipalign&lt;/b&gt; tool so that applications can be placed in the Play store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is now a &lt;b&gt;Progress Bar&lt;/b&gt; that displays while you are building your app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See other updates, fixes, and notes in the &lt;a href=&quot;//beta.appinventor.mit.edu/ReleaseNotes.html&quot;&gt;v130 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/AppInventorContest&quot;&gt;App Contest&lt;/a&gt;, taking place now in the &lt;a href=&quot;//gallery.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;App Inventor Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Inventing! ~Shay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>New Release: Screen arrangements, resizable video, and more</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2012/09/new-release-screen-arrangements-resizable-video-and-more</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing the newest App Inventor release!&lt;br /&gt;
Version 129 is now live. In addition to a few bug fixes and minor User Interface improvements, here are the exciting new features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resize-able and Full Screen Video support&lt;/strong&gt;. You can now resize an existing Video Player component from the blocks editor. In Android 2.0+ you can set a Video Player to use the entire phone&#039;s screen. The &lt;back&gt; key will restore it to its original size. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/videowall.html&quot;&gt;VideoWall tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start to check this out!&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal and Vertical Arrangements can now align their contents&lt;/strong&gt;. Arrangements and Screens can now align their contents along Left, Right, Center, Top and Bottom edges.&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: These settings have no effect if the arrangement size is set to automatic. The vertical setting has no effect if the screen is scrollable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canvas and Sprite Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;. The new events &quot;Flung&quot;, &quot;TouchUP&quot; and &quot;TouchDown&quot; have been added to Sprites and Canvases.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flung:&lt;/strong&gt; When a user touches a Sprite and then quickly swipes their finger in some direction, a &quot;Flung&quot; event is issued for the Sprite which gives the direction and speed of the swipe. This can be used to determine the direction and relative speed to move a Sprite. Canvases also receive a Flung event so a user can perform the swiping (Fling) motion anywhere on a Canvas and the MIT App Inventor programmer can decide how to handle it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TouchDown/TouchUp:&lt;/strong&gt; When a user places their finger on a Sprite, a TouchDown event is now triggered. When they lift their finger a TouchUP event is triggered. These events are in addition to the existing &quot;Touched&quot; event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New screen orientation settings:&lt;/strong&gt; (1) User (let&#039;s the app&#039;s user select portrait or landscape; and (2) Sensor (auto-rotates as the phone rotates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tutorials corresponding to these new features are coming soon so stay tuned. H*app*y Inventing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Ed Week features App Inventor as tool for engaging students</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/ed-week-features-app-inventor-tool-engaging-students</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check it out: Ed Week ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&quot;&gt;feature article on App Inventor&lt;/a&gt; and the power of teaching students how to build mobile apps. Many excellent programs are described in the article, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthapplab.com/&quot;&gt;Youth APPLab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iridescentlearning.org/programs/technovation-challenge/&quot;&gt;Technovation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthradio.org/&quot;&gt;Youth Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and others. My favorite quote is from an eighth grade girl: &quot;These programs expand your view on careers like computer science and engineering and show the fun in them.&quot; This is what we are all about at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning!&lt;br /&gt;
Read the article here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&quot;&gt;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Welcome to the new App Inventor website!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/welcome-new-app-inventor-website</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello again,&lt;br /&gt;
After a bit of a hiatus, this blog is back in action. I was waiting to post a new entry until we had successfully rolled out the NEW WEBSITE! Now that it&#039;s here, I&#039;d like to draw your attention to a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor website hosted at MIT (appinventor.mit.edu) is actually three separate sites: the &quot;explore&quot; site, the &quot;teach&quot; site, and the &quot;service&quot; site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C95828&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;service site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the site you already know and love as it hosts the actual App Inventor software where you build your own app projects. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#9AAE47&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;explore site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is geared toward the casual visitor as well as the veteran app builder. We will post news, project updates, stories about people using App Inventor, and things of that nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://teach.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#73B3DF&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;teach site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or educators&#039; site, is an oasis of information and support for people who are using App Inventor with students -- of any age and in any setting. This is the area where I will be focusing much of my energy over the next several months, as we build this site to include more education materials, and as we build the community by engaging people in joining in the exchange of ideas around App Inventor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is valued and welcome! Please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; your thoughts and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&#039;d like to let you know about the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Invitational&lt;/em&gt; App Inventor Summit on July 13/14 in Cambridge, MA. This meeting is intended to set the agenda for the App Inventor project for the next year. For more information, and to see how you can apply to participate, see the &lt;a href=&quot;../summit&quot;&gt;Summit Information page&lt;/a&gt;. Applications close June 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s all for now. Happy inventing...&lt;br /&gt;
Shay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>App Inventor helping to bridge gap in numbers of CS Majors</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/app-inventor-helping-bridge-gap-numbers-cs-majors</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Inventors,  One of our main goals at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning is to encourage greater participation in computing from a wider and more varied assortment of people. App Inventor does this by inherently fostering personal creativity with technology. I was pleased to see App Inventor mentioned in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&quot;&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Maggie Johnson, Google&#039;s Director of Education, in which she writes about the resurgence of CS Education: &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&quot;&gt;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&lt;/a&gt;  little by little...&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Hog Wild for App Inventor!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/hog-wild-app-inventor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello App Inventors, Things are moving right along here at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning. The community continues to grow and we have now topped the 90,000 mark for the number unique accounts on the App Inventor service! We have several initiatives underway to bring you new materials and learning opportunities. Stay tuned to this blog and to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum/index.html&quot;&gt;Educators&#039; forum&lt;/a&gt; for updates.  Today I&#039;d like to share an entertaining story... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;A science lab doesn&#039;t need to have a ceiling... a science lab doesn&#039;t even need to have walls!&quot;...&lt;/em&gt; Gina Hall McCarley, an Alabama high school teacher, shared a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories/wild-hogs-app&quot;&gt;story highlighting the usefulness of App Inventor as a tool for science exploration&lt;/a&gt;: tracking wildlife in a local forest. Using App Inventor, students programmed a simple data collection tool for documenting wild hog populations, to help scientists better understand a local environmental issue that has real-world implications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories?page=1&quot;&gt;Read more on the App Inventor stories pages&lt;/a&gt;, share these stories with other educators, and become inspired to help students create their own mobile tools for deepening learning across the curriculum.  Do you have a story to share? &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/contact&quot;&gt;Send it to us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
