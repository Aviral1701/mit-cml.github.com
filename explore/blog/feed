 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest post by &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.eduardovalle.com/&quot;&gt;Eduardo Valle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blog/eduardo-valle.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 20%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eu sou professor de Engenharia de Computação na UNICAMP, uma das principais universidades brasileiras. Meus colegas e eu estamos trabalhando para tornar mais diverso o público interessado nas profissões de Ciência, Tecnologia, Engenharia e Matemática; em particular queremos atrair mais garotas para a Ciência e a Engenharia de Computação. Minhas colegas conduziram um programa piloto com o App Inventor com garotas de uma escola pública do ensino médio no Brasil e obtiveram resultados incríveis, demonstrando que mesmo com todas as dificuldades um caminho é possível. Durante esse piloto, identificamos que a língua inglesa é uma forte barreira de entrada para essas meninas, muitas vezes em situações sociais desfavoráveis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fazer a tradução sempre esteve no meu mapa, mas eu achava que fosse uma montanha para carregar, uma tarefa para uma equipe enorme, e adiava o plano. Até que resolvi aproveitar o recesso no fim de 2015 para enfrentar o rojão e descobri que era muito mais fácil que eu pensava: a equipe do MIT foi super prestativa, e eram só 12 mil palavras para traduzir, o tamanho de dois contos. Além disso um terço da tradução já estava pronto, contribuído por usuários que chegaram antes de mim. Em poucos dias a tradução estava feita. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Torço para que que a disponibilidade do App Inventor em português abra oportunidades para muitos professores, alunos, entusiastas, e hobbistas no mundo lusófono. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In English:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&#039;m a Computer Engineering professore at UNICAMP, one of the most important Brazilian universities. My colleagues and I are working to diversify the interest in the STEM professions, and in particular to bring more girls to Computer Science, and to Computer Engineering. My colleagues conducted a pilot program with App Inventor for girls at a Brazilian public school, and got amazing results, showing that despite all difficulties, there is a way. During the pilot, we identified English language proficiency as a big entry barrier for those girls, many of whom come from socially disfavored families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since, translating App Inventor was in my radar, but I was under the impression it would be a gigantic task, and kept postponing that plan. I decided to use my 2015 Winter break to finally bite the bullet and do it. Then I found out the task was much easier than I thought: the MIT team was super helpful, and there were only 12 thousand words to translate, the size of two short stories. Besides, one third of the words was already translated, contributed by previous users. The translation was accomplished in just a few days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I hope that making App Inventor available in Portuguese will open opportunities for many Lusophone teachers, students, hobbyists and enthusiasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Google App Inventor Competition in China a Huge Success</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/01-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest blog post by Kathy Deng, Google China&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/kathy_deng.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 15%;&quot; /&gt;We just wrapped up the 2015 App Inventor contest for high school and middle school students in China [&lt;a href=&quot;http://app.gzjkw.net/GAIC2015/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contest website in Chinese&lt;/a&gt;], which rolled out in June. This is the 2nd year we ran this nationwide App Inventor contest. The goals were (1) to encourage high school students, middle school students, and upperclassmen at primary school to learn Computational Thinking, (2) to let students gain hands-on mobile application development experience through App Inventor and (3) to boost CS education among young students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the result of the collaboration between MIT, the Guangzhou Education Information Center and South China University of Technology, users in China can now access the local App Inventor server [&lt;a href=&quot;http://app.gzjkw.net/login/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the list of the highlights from this year’s contest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; A team of two female students took home with the first prize in the middle school group. Out of the 20 student teams selected for the final onsite competition, five were female student teams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantity &amp;amp; quality:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of submissions this year is 1,095, more than doubling last year’s numbers. We were told by the MIT App Inventor team judge that there was significant improvement in the quality of submitted apps. And he added this is the direct result from the promotion of App Inventor in China for the past three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More schools:&lt;/strong&gt; the contest got submissions from 258 schools which is an 80% increase compared to last year’s number. We found out more and more high and middle schools are interested in having opportunities for their students to learn CS in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/google_china_comp.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto; width: 60%;&quot; /&gt;On November 15, we held the onsite competition and awards ceremony at the Google Shanghai office. There were 10 high school teams, 10 middle school teams, parents and teachers in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Hal Abelson from MIT&lt;/strong&gt; to give a welcome speech to more than 70 attendees via Google Hangout video conference at the beginning of the event. Hal mentioned that when he created App Inventor at Google and MIT, he hoped that talented students could use mobile computing to make apps which are both creative and beautiful. This year’s submissions reaffirmed his goal. He was so proud of the students and offered a warm congratulation to students, parents, and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each finalist presented and demoed their applications to the judges, which included Google engineers and Weihua Li from the MIT App Inventor team. Below are the winning apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;●      First prize in high school group: Xushi (virtual robot assistant)&lt;br /&gt;
●      First prize in middle school group: Eyes Care (eye exam chart on app)&lt;br /&gt;
●      Other winning applications: Swap, iHouse, Fresh Food, Go to School, Run, BarCodeRegister, My Handbook, Fuxidashi (exam review master), XHTXQ (reminder), F1 Car Race, Calculator, Fighting, Foodline, Grader, Labyrinth, Life Assistant, SAT II Biology Helper, HalliGalli&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/chinese_comp_apps.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto; width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was great teamwork from Google, MIT App Inventor team, South China University of Technology (local partner), and Guangzhou Education Information Center (hosting local App Inventor server). All parties have contributed to this contest in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>US FIRST Robotics Uses App Inventor to Design Robot Controllers</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/01/us</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest post by Thomas Eng, US FIRST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/thomas-eng.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 15%;&quot; /&gt;FIRST is a non-profit organization, founded by inventor Dean Kamen, with a mission to inspire young people to pursue careers in science and technology.  FIRST engages children with exciting, Mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The FIRST Tech Challenge group organizes robotics competitions for children in grades 7 through 12.  Teams build robots from a kit of parts.  Teams use these robots to compete in themed competitions around the world.  For 2015-2016 season, teams are building robots to compete in the official FIRST Res-Q game, which models its challenges after mountain rescue situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 50%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;This season’s game, FIRST Res-Q, models its tasks after mountain rescue situations&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each team uses an Android Smartphone as the primary controller for their competition robot.  Teams can use a special branch of the MIT App Inventor to program their robot controllers and to create customized behaviors for their competition bots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 50%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;Teams build robots that are controlled by Android smartphones&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teams can use the MIT App Inventor to design their robot controller apps using special FTC-specific design components.  These FTC-specific design components allow the users to communicate with and control the hardware devices (motors, servos and sensors) that are installed on a robot.  The FTC-specific design blocks were implemented by an engineer from Google, Liz Looney, who was introduced to FIRST by Hal Abelson and his CSAIL team from MIT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first3.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 60%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first4.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 60%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because teams often do not have access to the Cloud at the competition venues for the FIRST Tech Challenge events, a solution was implemented that allows teams to run the MIT App Inventor locally, on their team laptops, using VirtualBox.  Teams design and build their robot controller apps with their local MIT App Inventor servers, and then the transfer and install them (typically using a USB cable) to their Android smartphones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 60%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Teams use VirtualBox to run the MIT App Inventor application locally on the laptops&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The MIT App Inventor has been very well received by the FIRST community.  App Inventor’s user friendly, visual interface and the easy-to-understand Blockly programming language makes the programming tasks more accessible and manageable, especially for novice programmers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto; width: 60%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The MIT App Inventor has been a particularly huge hit in the under-served areas… The students were joyful that they now had been empowered to make the robot move by themselves.  Thank-you.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; margin-right: 15%;&quot;&gt;

 <title>Students Win App Competition in Hong Kong with App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/01</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest post by AU Hoi Kin, Head of Academic Department, Pak Kau College, Hong Kong&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/chineseappwinners.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 30%;&quot; hspace=&quot;”5”&quot; vspace=&quot;”1”&quot; /&gt;Chiu Wai Hang, Chan Pak Long and Ho Kai Yui from Pak Kau College in Hong Kong were recent winners of an app development competition &lt;a href=&quot;http://hkaast.org.hk/%E9%97%9C%E6%84%9B%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Creative Invention - Mobile Apps&lt;/a&gt; held by The Hong Kong Association for the Advancement of Science and Technology. The students built an app to help people with intellectual disabilities who have trouble communicating with others and navigating when travelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The mobile application developed by the team contains two major functions. The first function helps persons with intellectual disabilities express a variety of emotions and ordinary conversation by using twelve simple and clear icons. The application provides pre-recorded soundtracks that play when users click selected icons. For example, users can click the police station icon to ask for help from passersby when they are lost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second major function is positioning. Supervisors can set a permissible area of travel for app users. The system will send an automatic message to the supervisor if the user is outside of the permissible travel area and will continuously report their position to the supervisor. This could be a useful function for elderly people too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The theme of the app competition was assisting a socially vulnerable group. There were four target social groups, with two round eliminations resulting in a champion, first runner-up and second runner-up in each group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The three team members, who are Secondary 4 students at Pak Kau College, admitted that there were many difficulties in creating their app. They needed to read many books and references and tried to “learn by doing”. One of the major difficulties they had was with the accuracy of the global positioning system (GPS). Although the positioning system was precise, there were some issues. For example, the positioning system can locate the users within a building but cannot determine which floor he/she is on. Therefore, their families cannot find them quickly using the app. To bolster the app’s functionality, the students added the communication feature. The users can take advantage of pre-recorded dialogue to communicate with others for help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The team had another major difficulty a few days before the competition. After finishing the final version of the app, they inadvertently deleted all their code. Since the program runs in the cloud, changes were auto saved. Sadly, the efforts of two months came to naught. Nevertheless, the students encouraged each other and bounced back. In the final days before the competition, they rewrote the code of the crude older version and finished the program. They learned a lot in the competition, especially mobile app programming and English.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the competition, the students have continued to improve the app in appearance and function, such as using a simple smiling face to be the image representing happy. The students want to add the function of daily conversation in addition to the current ability to ask for directions. The students would like to invite interested parties to try the app and test the difficulty level of operation. Then, the students can modify the app and make it more suitable and friendly to users. Hopefully, it can change people’s lives.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/BorisSquare.JPG&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 2%; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 20%;&quot; hspace=&quot;”5”&quot; vspace=&quot;”1”&quot; /&gt;Mobile Apps Academy web site  - &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinvent.ru/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://appinvent.ru&lt;/a&gt; was launched in Russia in December, 2015. The site is intended for Russian speaking school teachers who plan to teach development of Android apps with MIT App Inventor. The site contains manuals, presentations, lesson plans, a curriculum and media files, which a teacher might use to start teaching MIT App Inventor in their classroom. The materials can also be used by independent learners. Two initial cohorts of Russian teachers have already been instructed using the website materials. Several webinars and teacher training events were held this year and often was heard the question “What is next?” from teachers. So the Mobile Apps Academy website just announced a contest for Russian middle and high school students for the best app developed with MIT App Inventor. The contest committee will select the best project, taking into consideration its idea, design and code. If enough submissions are received, junior and senior subdivisions will be created. The deadline for submissions is May, 2016. The winner will receive a Samsung tablet as a prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;В декабре 2015 г.  в России был запущен веб сайт Академия мобильных приложений - &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinvent.ru/&quot;&gt;http://appinvent.ru/&lt;/a&gt; . Сайт предназначен для школьных учителей и всех тех, кто хотят научиться разработке мобильных приложений для Android с помощью MIT App Inventor. На сайте находятся рекомендации, презентации, разработки уроков, учебная программа, а также мультимедийные файлы, необходимые для того, чтобы начать преподавать основы MIT App Inventor в школе. Две первые группы российских учителей уже прошли обучение на основе материалов сайта. Кроме того, на сайте можно найти информацию о конкурсе для российских школьников на разработку лучшего мобильного приложения для Android, созданного с помощью MIT App Inventor. Конкурс продлится до 15 мая 2016 года. Его победителя ждет планшет от компании Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arjun is a 10th grader whose apps have made a large impact. His most popular app is Locatera - an app that allows parents and school administrators to track the school bus system! The app has three counterparts - one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_arjun_santhoshkumar.Locatera_Parent&quot;&gt;parents&lt;/a&gt;, one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_arjun_santhoshkumar.Locatera_Admin&quot;&gt;administrators&lt;/a&gt;, and one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_arjun_santhoshkumar.Locatera_Attendant&quot;&gt;students&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more about how Locatera works, you can watch Arjun&#039;s YouTube videos &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/0nFLCw3a3PQ&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This isn&#039;t the first time Arjun&#039;s apps have won awards. The predecessor to Locatera, EZ School Bus Locator, won several distinctions such as: First prize (K-8 Category) in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) App Inventor App Contest held in December 2012, Finalist in the ‘Global Discovery Academy Design App Contest’ held in October 2013 , and Finalist in the ‘mBillionth Award South Asia’ conducted by the Digital Empowerment Foundation (DEF) in July 2013. Additionally, Locatera won our &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/app-month-gallery.html&quot;&gt;App Of the Month contest&lt;/a&gt; in October!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor team is extremely proud of Arjun and all the other contest winners. We love to hear that young people are using App Inventor to improve their communities and make an impact on the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see all of the apps created by Arjun&#039;s company, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lateralogics.com/&quot;&gt;LateraLogics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=6823169663757249292&amp;amp;hl=en&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>App Inventor Team Watches CodeGirl</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/emilyg/2015/12/app</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/cRb5iel-3Ck/maxresdefault.jpg&quot; height=&quot;250px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, December 12, the App Inventor team got together to watch CodeGirl, a documentary that follows high school girls participating in the Technovation Challenge - an international competition where girls from all over the world develop apps to change their communities. Many of the girls who participate in the competition use App Inventor to develop their apps, and our team was so happy to see the impact that App Inventor is having on girls all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aubrey, a Masters student, was impressed by the cohesion of the teams and how effectively they collaborated. I agree - the girls in this documentary showed an exceptional amount of maturity and teamwork as they created their apps and business models. Though many of the teams didn&#039;t qualify for later rounds in the competition, they all demonstrated a strong work ethic and a desire to shape their communities. Tiffany, an undergraduate researcher, said, &quot;I thought that it was neat to see how all of the teams had such different journeys and in the end make a positive impact on their communities.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, many of us were impacted by the use of App Inventor in this film. Our team strives to make coding more accessible to people (especially young people and women) all over the world, and it makes us so proud to see that many of these amazingly talented young women were using App Inventor to reach their goals. Kristin, another one of our Masters students, said it best: &quot;It was really inspiring to see the way App Inventor and similar tools can be used to enable people with great ideas to see them through.  Opening that door to the world brings a greater diversity of problems and ideas to the table that we can only solve by working together, making the world a better place as a result.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mexican Students Win Top Spot in National Science Fair with App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2015/12-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two female Mexican students, Roxana Galilea and Reyna Guadalupe, won first place in a national science fair (Expo Ciencia Nacional 15) using App Inventor. Their prototype app, Digi Voz Sistem, can recognize voice commands and transmit them through Bluetooth to an Arduino microprocessor to open doors, turn lights on and off, and even start up a car. The two students agree that this project has positively changed their lives. Both are now considering careers in the science and technology fields. They are excited and proud to represent Mexico at the International event, CIENCAP, that will take place in Asuncion, Paraguay  in 2016.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is another wonderful example of the amazing things young people are creating with App Inventor. We wish Roxana and Reyna the best of luck in Paraguay.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/iVolunteerLogo.png&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; /&gt;When &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-34988142&quot;&gt;deadly floods hit the Indian city of Chennai&lt;/a&gt; (Madras) in early December 2015, the &lt;a href=&quot;/stories/k-8-division-international-app-winner&quot;&gt;award winning app inventor&lt;/a&gt;, Arjun Kumar put on his inventor’s hat once again, to build his newest app, iVolunteer for Chennai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently available in the Google Play Store, iVolunteer for Chennai coordinates aid between those offering aid and those in need of such aid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We commend Arjun for springing to action and hope that his work and others’ use of his app will help the people of Chennai affected by the recent flooding.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Superior Deca Squad Participates in FIRST Lego League</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2015/12</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/SDS.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 0.5em; &quot; hspace=&quot;”5”&quot; vspace=&quot;”1”&quot; /&gt;Last week I had the privilege of meeting, via Skype, the members of the Superior Deca Squad from Herndon, VA. They were preparing to present their project at the Virginia State Meet of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll&quot;&gt;FIRST (for the Inspiration and Recognition of Science &amp;amp; Technology) Lego League (FLL)&lt;/a&gt;.  These ten eager and innovative 5th graders from Oak Hill Elementary School in Herndon were very poised and enthusiastic as they explained to me their vision for Cam Can, a system of recycling bins that would scan, automatically sort, weight, drain, and compact recycled items. Their unique system would also reward users with game tokens and gift cards, to entice long term use, and increase recycling trash from 33% to 67% in their county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another piece of their project was a prototype for an app made with App Inventor that would notify the user of nearby recycling bins so they could find a place to recycle. In addition, the app would allow the user to scan a QR code to earn credits for recycling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each member of the team spoke about their part in the project. Some worked on programming their robot, others the App Inventor app, while others focused on the presentation and marketing materials. All members of the team were involved in research on the topic of trash and recycling. The team visited their county waste management facility, a security data destruction company, and a hospital to see how each of those organization deal with trash. Close to home, they met with the head of their school cafeteria to talk trash. As a result of their meeting, the simple solution of relocation of the recycling bin in the cafeteria improved the percentage of recycling that took place at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They competed on December 5 at the Virginia State Meet at James Madison University, along with 108 other teams. Their research scores and performance were Exemplary, and they were in the top performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of FLL, they also competed in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Teamwork judging; learning that TEAM stands for teachable, energizer, achiever, &amp;amp; mission focused; and used gracious professionalism (respect and kindness to enhance team communication and relating to others).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Technical and Robot judging: They designed a robot and programmed mission runs, using EV3 programming, to run their robot through an obstacle course designed by FLL.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From my interaction with these students, I definitely saw their collaboration and teamwork. Each team member participated, was respectful of each other, and was excited about their project. It was a pleasure to see such enthusiasm for solving a real world problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FIRST LEGO League &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge#block-block-19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TRASH TREK℠ Challenge&lt;/a&gt; involved more than 233,000 children ages 9 to 16 from over 80 countries to explore the fascinating world of trash and to design solutions for it. &lt;/p&gt;
