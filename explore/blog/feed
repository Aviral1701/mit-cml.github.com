&lt;div style=&quot;width: 55%; margin: auto; display: block; padding-top: 20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;b&gt;Every problem has its solution. You just have to be creative enough to find it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;Each year nationwide, there are reports of young children being dropped off of school buses in the wrong neighborhoods, unable to find their way home, and widespread reports in the media of children who are inadvertently left on the bus alone, posing a dangerous health risk. Most children live in households where families work, making it difficult for parents to be home to ensure the safe departure and arrival of their children. School notification systems contact parents during the first hours of school if their child has an unreported absence. Parents often are not aware if their children have returned home at the appropriate time until parents discover them missing hours later. The significant lapse in time can mean the difference between life and death. We put our creativity to the test to find a solution for this problem and created BusBudE Secure Travel Notification System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the BusBudE Team, middle school and high school students from South Fayette Township School District near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Each member has their own individual role and duty that helps our team stay organized and efficient. Our team includes: Co-project Managers: Joe Cavanaugh (grade: 11), Parv Shrivastava (grade: 8); Director of Computer Programming: Sam Cohen (grade: 11); Computer Programming Team: Anish Thangavelu (grade: 8), Vinay Pedapati (grade: 9); and Director of Business Marketing: Meghan Banerjee (grade: 12). We are part of the Emerging Innovation Leaders Program led by South Fayette’s Director of Technology and Innovation, Aileen Owens. Our goal for BusBudE is to create a system that helps young students board the bus safely and allows parents peace of mind knowing their child is safe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BusBudE is a product designed to help keep students safe while traveling to and from school on the school bus. Currently we are beta testing our product design. Our plan for the future is to create system for parents to register their young children for this service. Currently during beta testing our children receive a tag and small device attached to their backpack. As children enter the bus they scan their BusBudE tag to the mobile device on the bus. Immediately a text message is sent to the child’s parents alerting them as to the date, time, and location that their child enters and leaves the bus. Parents know exactly where their children are when they enter and exit the bus. The BusBude application is designed to increase students’ safety and decrease parents’ fears and apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical Aspects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-screenshot.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin-left: 10px;&quot; /&gt;BusBudE uses a variety of technology within a cohesive system to keep children safe.  Currently, the major components of BusBudE are near field communication (NFC) tags and a NFC-capable phone.  We envision every bus outfitted with a phone that has NFC capabilities. Each participating student will receive a tag with customized information specific to each child and a custom designed tag holder. When the students enter the bus, they will scan their NFC tag to the NFC reader on the phone. Each phone is loaded with the BusBudE application which takes in the student’s information and puts it into a text that is sent to his or her parents.  Here is an example of a text message:  Sara is getting off bus 10 at 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We designed the prototype app for BusBudE using App Inventor. The app has a variety of features. The features include an accurate location and time based algorithm that detects whether the student is getting on or off the bus in the morning or the afternoon.  With this algorithm, bus drivers do not have to manually select whether a student is getting on or off the bus as we did in an earlier iteration.  Additionally, a notification sounds when the phone as read the tag to notify the student if his or her NFC tag has been scanned, a necessary feature that we added after our first beta test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featured below is a small snippet of the code that takes the name of the student and phone number from the NFC tag.  It shows the BusBudE logo and a counter that increases by 1 every time the student has scanned their tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-blocks.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design Stages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we designed the prototype version of the device and programmed the tags and the reader, we decided to beta test the application with a small group of students and their parents. We selected 5 students in 1st and 2nd grade from Bus 10 and ran the first beta test in March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-diagram.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right; width: 30%; margin-left: 10px;&quot; /&gt;The test concentrated on specific research questions to help develop the app to meet our user needs. We focused on analyzing the technical facets of the device and the students’ responses. The questions we focused on included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would the technical aspects of the device work effectively and efficiently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would there be any time restraints or issues scanning and receiving text messages? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would the device be easy for the students to use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We held a parent-student training session with five students and their parents from 1st and 2nd grade to explain exactly what the product was intended to do. After distributing the individual badges, we ran through a practice run with the students to set expectations and explain how to scan their badges through role-playing. During the first beta test the device had the capacity to send a text to the student’s parent or guardian with a notification to let parents know that their childe had entered or exited the bus. We provided training for the bus driver and with her assistance located the best placement for the device on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-team.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin-right: 10px;&quot; /&gt;On the morning and afternoon of the beta test, Aileen Owens rode the bus and monitored the students, observing and taking notes. After each alert was received, parents texted back to Aileen’s cell phone to let her know that they received the alert. She could then see in real time when students scanned and when the text was received. Parents reported that they received the texts and provided enthusiastic and positive feedback. The first beta test was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the lessons we learned from this beta test were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scanning cards was easy for the students and was accomplished quickly without significant delay to the bus schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reading device on the bus was positioned right for the elementary school children to scan without difficulty. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parents really loved the fact that they were receiving texts that alerted them to the fact that their children were safely riding the bus at the right times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential areas for improvement were also discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was no visual cue on the reading device that allowed students to see that their card had been scanned. As a result, some students scanned multiple times since they were not sure if their scan had been completed. As a result, some parents received multiple text messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another area for improvement was the handling of the reading device on the bus. The Bus driver suggested that the device be switched on at the start of the route and switched off at the end of the route, so that the driver did not have to touch the device at any time during the trip. If the driver were to touch the device anytime in between, it could potentially send repeat messages to parents, and cause confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The driver also recommended that the text message sends an alert to parents stating the bus number that the students entered. She explained that one of the biggest challenges for elementary students is learning to board the correct bus. There are times that students take a different bus route home from school when traveling to parents living in separate households.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The first beta test presented us with several areas for improvement which we incorporated into the second iteration of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The responses and results of this test were reported to Josh Sheldon, an App Inventor team member from MIT. One of his suggestions was to program the device to include the location of the student when entering and exiting the bus. Josh explained to the team how to use the location sensor feature on the App Inventor program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The team made this addition to the device, upgraded to a higher data plan, and tested the second iteration of the program through a second beta test. This beta test was also successful.  Our team began preparing to expand the device to accommodate more students, and to make adjustments to the badge size and look, with the idea of theoretically scaling-up for implementation for our school transportation department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beta Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-screenshot2.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot; /&gt;After the original beta test that took place in mid-2015 with children in grades K-2, the BusbudE team took the opportunity to test an alternate use of the design and to consider product flexibility. South Fayette belongs to Digital Promise, League of Innovative Schools, a nationwide organization designed to accelerate innovation in education. The League hosts meetings twice a year in different parts of the country. In October 2015 they chose to host their meeting in Pittsburgh and visit three League schools including South Fayette. Our BusBudE team prepared 70 tags for visitors. Each visitor was assigned to one of four groups and each group followed a different schedule for the day. When visitors entered the bus to travel from downtown Pittsburgh to South Fayette they scanned their tags and their specific schedule, as well as information and web site links about South Fayette’s computational thinking and STEAM program, was texted to their phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This beta test of the product provided excellent results. We were able to show that BusBudE could be adapted and configured for other uses. From this beta test we were able to move through another iteration of the application and promptly moved back to development for the intended age group in order to complete a larger beta test in early 2016.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The beta test that was completed in March 2016 included 38 students in 1st – 5th grade riding Bus 10. This beta test was a user-centered interaction test with a larger population specifically designed for the following reasons. We changed the plastic 3D printing device that holds the NFC tag and needed to discover: (1) were the devices designed appropriately for small hands, (2) could students use the device effectively, (3) would larger numbers of students scanning tags significantly delay or affect the bus schedule, and (4) to discover any additional challenges or obstacles that must be addressed. During this third test, we encountered our first issue with the system. In the morning students scanned when entering the bus but their parents did not receive the text alert. However, the afternoon test worked well. Parents received the text alerts when students entered and exited the bus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From this test we learned that we need to build a failsafe system into the BusBudE application. We realize that before the phone was attached to the bus it was dropped down several stairs of the bus. The phone must have turned off but because of the way the case was designed there was no way to visually see that the phone was disconnected. The team is working on a re-design to address this issue. In addition, the team is working on a way to design the app so that students can scan without touching the device to make the scanning process faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future of BusBudE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently BusBudE is in its beta stages, thus there are many aspects that need to be altered and adapted before our product can truly be finished.  In terms of upgrading our system, we would like to integrate a clear light and sound indication for the students.  This would allow them to recognize if their tag scanned and if they are on the correct bus by using a green light and a sound notification for the correct bus and a red light with a sound alert if they are on the wrong bus.  We are also looking into the addition of an external display indicating the status of the scanned NFC tag as a solution to this problem.  Also, we are currently working to edit our code to enable more features such as precise GPS location notification and to further enhance the reach of the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The NFC tags we had purchased for previous beta tests weren&#039;t cost effective and were a temporary solution, thus we have started collaborating with an Australian based start-up to lower costs for mass orders and integrate our logo onto each tag.  We currently use a phone for our NFC scanner, yet in future iterations we would like to change it to a customized scanner specifically for BusBudE to include increased proximity and reliability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have already conducted several beta tests, yet with every revision to BusBudE we would like to hold at least one beta test to observe the effect of each specific change in our product. In the future we hope to include full functionality and use of the application serving every student within the South Fayette School District.  From this point, assuming the implementation is successful, we would like to begin to expand to other districts and potentially become an entrepreneurship venture.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Welcome 30 New Master Trainers in Mobile Educational Computing</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/josh/2016/03-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blogs/master_trainers_group.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an spectacular experience this past week – we had 30 people, from 18 countries, come together to be trained as MIT Master Trainers in Mobile Educational Computing (with MIT App Inventor), put together jointly with the MIT Professional Education Short Programs group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with the amazing folks who’ve been master trainers with the Verizon program, we now have ~40 Master Trainers, &amp; they are wonderful - we will soon have a full listing of these folks and their contact information so you can begin to take advantage of their awesome skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks and congratulations to Karen Lang and Marsha Gordon and her Short Programs staff, all of whom did an enormous amount of work for this, and to Dave Wolber, who flew cross country and provided amazing guidance and instruction. Thanks as always to Hal, for his leadership and inspired opening talk. And of course, thanks to Jeff &amp; Andrew for their presentations &amp; answers to MANY questions. Thanks too, to Cynthia Solomon, for her inspiration, guidance, and thoughtful presentation. And without Marisol Diaz, we wouldn’t have had the logistics or amazing reception on Thursday evening. Finally, thanks to Mel Robinson for making sure all the final details were taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blogs/happy_hal.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Altona Middle School Team Builds Diction Defender App</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/03</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/denver1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%; margin-left: 10px;&quot; /&gt;Last weekend, I had the pleasure of meeting the Altona Middle School team from Longmont, Colorado, who is one of the eight Best in Nation Verizon App Challenge winners. They were beginning their App Inventor training to learn the skills necessary to develop their app, Diction Defender, over the next few months. In the morning, MIT Master Trainer, Ann Root, took the students through the storyboarding process where the students designed the order and layout of the various app screens. The afternoon was spent working directly with App Inventor. Each student worked on a separate App Inventor tutorials, each with a different focus or feature. Then the students came together to share what they have learned with the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/denver2.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%; margin-right: 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The app is intended to help students become better writers by leading them through a game that features a series of grammar questions with increasing degrees of difficulty. The game theme is a journey through different landscapes on an island, with pitfalls if the user answers incorrectly. Their mentor and computer science teacher, Mollie Kelleher, a former English teacher, is helping the team with the grammar side of things. The game is highly visual, so the artistic abilities of team members will be a big part of the user interface. There are some tricky technical algorithms for the students to work out, but they appear to be up for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The enthusiasm and energy was high as the students began what will be an intensive few months of development. In June, they will present their app at National TSA Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. It was a great experience to see this team in action and I look forward to seeing and playing Diction Defender in June. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>New Release Coming (nb147)</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/jeff/2016/02/new</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will be deploying a new release of MIT App Inventor on Thursday&lt;br /&gt;
afternoon on February 18th (2016-02-19 02:00:00 UTC). The details are&lt;br /&gt;
in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1w_QMUBTmHGFGyekjF1OiBz6cNpSyZ5oPenUigwlZmj8/pub&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Release Notes (DRAFT).&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- break --&gt;&lt;p&gt;This release adds new Components and Features to MIT App Inventor&lt;br /&gt;
and we will be deploying a new Companion App along with the&lt;br /&gt;
release. However the current Companion (version 2.35) will continue to&lt;br /&gt;
work, but new features will require an upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have downloaded the Companion from the Google Play Store and&lt;br /&gt;
set it to auto-update, the update should be seamless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However if you “side loaded” the Companion, or are using the&lt;br /&gt;
emulator, then you will need to update the Companion manually. We will&lt;br /&gt;
not be triggering an “Auto Update.” So people running classes on&lt;br /&gt;
Friday the 19th will not get a surprise when they attempt to use the&lt;br /&gt;
emulator in class. We have added a new menu choice under the “Help”&lt;br /&gt;
menu (you won’t see it until the release) which will permit you to&lt;br /&gt;
upgrade your companion “on the fly” on a schedule of your&lt;br /&gt;
choosing. Again, if you downloaded the Companion from the Google Play&lt;br /&gt;
Store, and auto-update is set, you will get the upgrade without having&lt;br /&gt;
to take any action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>App Inventor program in Germany receives 250.000 € from Google.org</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/02/app</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest blog post by Diana Knodel, AppCamps Germany&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/diana.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 15%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appcamps.de&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;App Camps&lt;/a&gt; is a German non-profit that uses the MIT App Inventor to teach coding and app development in schools. Out of thousands of projects, the non-profit was selected as a finalist in the Google Impact Challenge Germany. App Camps receives 250.000 € (about 280.000 $) from Google.org to expand the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a public voting an overall winner will be selected. The winner will receive another 250.000 €.  It would be awesome to get support from the App Inventor community. Please vote for us &lt;a href=&quot;https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/deutschland/charity/app_camps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did it all start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started App Camps as a side project back in 2013. The first workshop - an App Summer Camp for girls - was a huge success. After this event we got many requests from kids, parents, teachers and schools. Doing these workshops was great fun. But we reached to few students and thus decided to change our approach: We developed a platform and digital teaching materials for teachers in German language. That way they can teach coding without us being present in person. On the platform teachers get all materials including online training in order to do coding workshops in their classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The course on App development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently providing teaching material for seven App Inventor sessions. Teachers get access to short videos and learning cards that are printed out for the students. In each session, the students build their own apps. Over the course of seven sessions they learn the basics of coding and app development. In the end of the course each students has his or her own quiz app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/teaching.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto; width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also use agile development methods in the course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Standup:&lt;/strong&gt; Sessions always start with a stand up. Students come together to watch a short video in which the app is presented and they see some live coding. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pair Programming:&lt;/strong&gt; The students do pair programming and learn how to discuss code. They are guided by learning cards and can work in their own pace. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Review:&lt;/strong&gt; Near the end of the session all students meet again for a review and to discuss the app and learnings.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each session ends with a short video in which engineers explain the most important concepts of the session, for example variables, if-else, or methods. The engineers work for tech companies like Github, Adobe, Soundcloud or XING. With these videos, students have the chance to “meet” tech rolemodels and hear interesting things about Tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Course evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this approach we were able to reach more than 1.500 students in only four months as compared to 500 students in two years. As a non-profit we want to make a social impact. Both students and teachers fill out questionnaires before and after the course. Here are first results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/appcamps_results.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto; width: 75%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the course on App development students&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;want to continue to code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think coding is more fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a better understanding of the work of programmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can imagine choosing a career that involves coding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teachers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;really like the App inventor and the materials we provide. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;say that it is very likely that they recommend the course to other teachers (9.5 on a scale from 1 to 10). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are highly interested in additional courses on programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to reach 15.000 students within the next two years and to grow the App Inventor community in German speaking countries. We will also develop additional courses on App development and other topics. The funding from the Google Impact Challenge helps us to continue what we do. It would be great if you support us and vote for us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/deutschland/charity/app_camps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/deutschland/charity/app_camps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Congratulations to all the winners, not only of the Best in Nation, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://appchallenge.tsaweb.org/sites/appchallenge.tsaweb.org/files/press-room/BestState-2016%20pdf%20for%20website-flat.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Best in State&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://appchallenge.tsaweb.org/sites/appchallenge.tsaweb.org/files/press-room/BestRegion-2016-pdf%20for%20website-flat.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Best in Region&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Middle school and high school teams from around the nation developed ideas for apps that addressed a need in their school or community. They wrote essays describing their design process, their app’s functionality, and its potential impact or outcome. In addition, each team produced a 3 minute video describing the app and its impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best in Nation Team Winners receive a $15,000 grant to build the app from their winning design and to enhance STEM education at their schools or site. MIT App Inventor Master Trainers will be working with the nine national finalists in person and virtually to develop their app over the next few months. Winning teams will present their apps at the TSA National Conference in Nashville, TN, in June. &lt;/p&gt;
