 <title>Reactions to a CS10k Webinar: Block Party</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/adminexplore/2015-1</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This post is re-blogged from &lt;a href=&quot;https://csforhumanity.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/reactions-to-a…ar-block-party/&quot;&gt;https://csforhumanity.wordpress.com/2015/10/12/reactions-to-a…ar-block-party/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I write this without having listened to the recording of the first half of the webinar, “Block Party: Meet Some of the Creative Minds Behind Blockly, Scratch, and More!”, which took place live on the evening of October 7, 2015. I hope my reactions prove spurious after listening to the recording of the full webinar. I am afraid, however, they will not be. And at the very least, they reflect my experience. I hope they will resonate with some others, and encourage you to share your enthusiasm for computing with others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I listened to, and participated in the chat for approximately the last 25 minutes of the event. There was certainly some interesting discussion, among some very enlightened and well- meaning people, representing thought leaders in Computer Science and/or Computing Education.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given that, however, I cannot help but ask question: “Why did the majority of what I heard focus narrowly on how we teach what is often taken as a vocational skill, namely programming, most effectively?” There were a few half-hearted nods to computer science-specific formulations. The message I got loud and clear, however, was that we should figure out how can we get kids proficient in Java(script) as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it intrigues me that this ended up being the case. I know many of the people who participated, and they believe firmly in much more transcendent ideals. Why, one of the curricula based on one of these blocks languages is entitled “The Beauty and Joy of Computing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently had a small difference of opinion with Dr. Mark Guzdial on Facebook, in which I critiqued an article about new CS courses in Georgia for emphasizing only the vocational good they could do. His response, paraphrased, was “that’s often how these things end up getting sold.” Much more exclusively on that idea in another post, but to boil it down, there’s much more to computing and any of these languages, and we lose so much richness when we devolve into a discussion of optimizing teaching of programming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not saying anything particularly new, but computing to me is about much more than the act of programming. Programming is often the last stage of a bout of computing. First, we assess the problem in our head, devising a strategy to approach it. We (why “We” and not “I”? Because computing is rarely a solitary endeavor,) may discuss it with peers, we may sketch flowcharts or notes on whiteboards or in notebooks. We often search for facts and figures, data, that have nothing to do with computers, but about the real-world problem we are trying to solve with an application of computing. Using a variety or combination of methods, decomposition/solution of parts/reassembly; machine learning; data mining; etc., we plan, eventually program and test, then repeat to find better, and finally adequate solutions. This, for tonight, is my barely adequate description of an experience of computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why the disparity then, between the possible discussion space and what ended up being talked about? Certainly it was not because the blocks languages that were being discussed are learning or play languages. Scratch and the languages that spawned from it scaffold creativity of several kinds. Alice and its relatives are also about self-expression, though with a slightly different flavor. Pencil Code, to my poor estimation, strives to give fast ability to control real tools. Admittedly, though, I’m biased, and know the most about about one particular tool, MIT App Inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT App Inventor strives to give beginners and experienced programmers fast control over mobile devices (yes, still Android only) through high level abstractions that allow the app creator to do real, meaningful things. What does that mean? There are myriad examples, ranging from crowdsourcing access to sanitary toilets in Lagos, to developing apps for tracking student location on school and/or city buses, both domestically in the US and in Bangalore, among other locations. Are they all so goody-goody? No - kids (and adults) make fart noise apps too - and those are popular and exciting, and represent the thrill of computing as well - they allow the app inventor to make something that promotes cognitive dissonance - a phone farting!?! How much more fun, and relatively innocently disruptive can you get?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to close, let’s strive to elevate the discussion - let’s talk about the Beauty and Joy of Computing, farting phones and all. Let’s talk about why we love computing, and how programming enables that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Somehow, with only a gut feeling to support this, I suspect that we should curtail our inclination to debate in the esoteric weeds the relative merits of one blocks-to-text conversion tool vs. another. Instead, let’s spend more time developing and telling the inspirational stories to pass to youth who may not hear them otherwise. Enthusiasm is contagious, sometimes… I’m convinced if we share our true enthusiasm for problem solving and computing, vs. vigorously discussing arcane points, we will share that youthful enthusiasm with a larger AND broader audience of youth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Making the Hilltop Sunset App Part 2: Problem Solving and Creating a Song List</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/ryan/2015/10/making</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well, it turns out I was right; I was able to make lists delete entries as I’d set out to do at the end of my last post! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was a bit more complicated than anything else I had done: I had to combine a “Remove List Item” block with an “Index Item” block where the indexed “thing” was joined to a block listing my Wheel-O-Songs button with its current text. That way, it would remove that item from the specified list! Once that was accomplished, I figured it’d be good to include some text letting the user know they’ve reached the end of the list. And after that, I was done! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;...but then I started thinking of some other additions for my lackluster app. Before I knew it, I had a whole slew of upgrades to the app that I had never planning on incorporating, including a song list from two albums of mine, with lyrics; two additional randomizer buttons that selected only songs from a specified album; and a link to my main website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the new direction I was taking my app, I figured a Home page would benefit me, so I made a new screen, included a label with the title “Hilltop Sunset” (the name of my music project) and added 3 buttons: Visit Main Website, View Song List, and Wheel-O-Songs. After this, I made corresponding screens for those buttons to redirect when clicked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really wanted to include a list of songs and their lyrics because people often ask to know what my lyrics are, whether because they’re hearing a song for the first time and want to make sure they catch every word or because they want to sing along. To do this, I first experimented with some of the basic list options available in the Designer tools, but after testing ListPicker and ListView I decided that neither could adequately accomplish what I wanted. I ended up making individual Buttons for every song--at this point there were 22 of them instead of just the 16 from Part 1--and sorted them by album. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next task was to figure out how I was going to include the lyrics. To do this, I tried making a label and changing its text to a huge body of lyrics when a specified song was clicked. Unfortunately I ran into several problems, mostly that the text ran straight off the phone’s window because there didn’t seem to be any way to put the text on multiple lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I added a textbox instead of a label, the multiline option became available from the Design window, but the formatting was atrocious; the whole song was just a block of text mushed together with no defined line breaks. After some quick research, I discovered that including “\n” in the text created a line break! I went through and typed out my lyrics, including “\n” with every break, and it worked like magic! I was so thrilled to finally see my lyrics--well-formatted--displayed whenever I clicked a song. The lyrics popped up directly underneath the name of the album the song was from, just as they were supposed to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only thing about using a textbox instead of a label is that it’s able to be edited in the app. This was fine in my instance, since the changes aren’t ever saved when input, and the app was intended for personal use anyway. But if you don’t want people having the ability to edit your text, perhaps you’ll be better off finding another way to work around the limitations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next week I’ll go over how I linked my website, added the album-specific randomizers, and changed the colors of...everything. Because the default colors are very harsh and clashing. Stay tuned! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

The UNESCO YouthMobile Initiative has launched the 1st of a series of training workshops of young students in mobile apps programming in Abuja, Nigeria. The training program was based on the beginner and intermediate levels of the App Inventor curriculum from the well acclaimed Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, USA).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Samsung Electronics supported by donating laptops used during the training. Some of the Apps that were developed and demonstrated by the students for education including literacy or sustainable development include:&lt;br /&gt;
·         Know your Country&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·         Hydrating Education&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·         English Pro&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·         Learn Alphabets&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;·         Other Apps include Calc Plus, Safety App, Web Locator, My Career Guide, My Review, Musical App, Story Telling App and Health Tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second segment of the YouthMobile training is has been planned to hold at the Samsung/UNESCO Digital Village in Oban Town, Cross River State in partnership with Team Charis Nigeria, made up of a group of girls from Calabar, Cross River State in Nigeria. Team Charis won the High School Division of the UNESCO-supported 2015 Technovation Global Challenge in San Francisco, America with their app “Discardious,” a mobile solution to the problem of improper waste disposal in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;MIT App Inventor will be participating in the &lt;a style=&quot;color: #f15a29; white-space: nowrap;&quot; href=&quot;http://en.unesco.org/9th-unesco-youth-forum/&quot;&gt;UNESCO Youth Forum “Youth for Change” conference&lt;/a&gt; in Paris, France, October 26-28, 2015. As the Manager of Educational Outreach and Business Development, I will be speaking about new MIT App Inventor initiatives and opportunities for educators and young people to participate in, contribute to, and benefit from mobile computing education.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;The Youth Forum takes place every 2 years and gathers exceptional young people ages 18-24 from UNESCO member states, to speak about their involvement in youth-related issues at a local, community and country level. This year the theme centers on sustainable development and climate change.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;In addition to hearing how young people are tackling local problems and mobilizing resources, attendees will also hear from various experts from organizations and projects around the world. Past participants have included representatives from Mozilla, Intel, FOSSFA, FOSSASIA, Orange, All Dev Camp, Technovation, The MASH Project, Apps for Good, Esprit, m:Lab East Africa/ eMobilis, Nairobi Dev School and MIT App Inventor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Here’s a quick run down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:16px; color:#3ebbbd; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;What is Youth Radio?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;YR is a media production company started in 1992 to offer young people a way to bring their voices to various media streams by creating content and engaging other youth through technology. YR offers practical course work in journalism, creative arts, digital photography, web design, social media, video production, technology, app development, and podcasts (to name a few). And as you can guess from the name, Youth Radio produces a weekly radio show with original content and topics relevant to today’s youth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:16px; color:#3ebbbd; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;YR and MIT App Inventor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;YR takes creating content very seriously and they even developed an app to help them deliver their original content! Students created 5 different prototypes of an app and with the help of Google, MIT, and the University of San Francisco, narrowed down the many options to include the following functionality: story sharing, collecting media from listeners and a podcast rating system. Here are a few screenshots of the final product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/Youth%20Radio%20App%20Screen%20Shot.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Download the &lt;a style=&quot;color: #3ebbbd; white-space: nowrap:&quot; href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_asha.YOUTHRADIOapp_BETA&quot;&gt;Youth Radio App Inventor App&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Play store and start tuning in!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:16px; color:#3ebbbd; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;App Making&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;The YR website offers links to app making tutorials suited for beginning, intermediate or advanced app developers. Doing tutorials is necessary when learning new technical skills, but what about when you want to venture off on your own to make an app from scratch? How in the world do you get started? Maybe you have no idea what to create or maybe you have too many ideas and can’t pick just one. YR has a &lt;a style=&quot;color: #3ebbbd; white-space: nowrap:&quot; href=&quot;https://youthradio.org/creative-studio/article/draft-diy-toolkit-how-to-come-up-with-your-own-mobile-app/&quot;&gt;DIY Toolkit &lt;/a&gt;to help you unravel the Mobile App Ideation process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:16px; color:#3ebbbd; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Make a Hip Hop History App (you know you want to!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;This tutorial reviews the basics in case you’re a beginning coder and need a little introduction to App Inventor. Once you have the hang of navigating the App Inventor platform, the Hip Hop History App tutorial will have you diving in to uploading media, defining variables, creating lists, making a slider and creating a player. These tools will come in handy for any app you make and will most probably inspire you to create other apps that will display images, use audio samples, or make use of a slider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Making the Hilltop Sunset App Part 1: Wheel-O-Songs, a List Randomizer</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/ryan/2015/09/making</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I built my very own original app on MIT App Inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a computer scientist, I’m not an expert programmer, and I’ve never taken any classes on the subject; I’m just a singer/songwriter with a degree in English and Creative Writing--and a dream. But even with literally zero knowledge of coding, MIT App Inventor’s simple building-block style (with the help of a handful of tutorials scattered about YouTube) allowed me to take a basic concept and turn it into a functional program within a little over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t start with any particularly revolutionary ideas; I just thought it would be fun to have a program that would randomly select one of my original songs at the push of a button. That way, if anyone ever wanted me to play something and inevitably couldn’t decide what, I could open this app, hit the button, and voila! An answer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking care of the app’s design was quick and simple: the display was shown immediately and a list of items--buttons, lists, images, etc.--was available for me to drag and drop, adding them instantly to my app and providing me with a list of options to customize how each item appeared on-screen. All I needed for my app was a single button that read “Wheel-O-Songs” and I was good to go. I changed the font color, background color, centered it, enlarged it, and was ready to work on making it a functional button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the language and functions of App Inventor did take some getting used to, fluency comes with practice. The majority of blocks are fairly easy to understand, provided you read them with the right mindset. In most instances the blocks read as normal English, but stripped down to only its essential, basic components. For example, there is a block that reads “When Button1 .Click, do _______,” and you can fill in the blank with any number of command blocks. Basically all that block means is, “When Button1 is clicked, it will perform the command ________.” I used this block in my app in conjunction with a “randomize list” command block so that when my Wheel-O-Songs button is clicked, it randomly selects an item from a specified list and changes the text of the button to the new selected item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly discovered the blocks are not always self-explanatory to newcomers. For instance, the “initialize global” block confused me at first, since I wasn’t familiar with the concept of global variables or what exactly that meant, or how it could be useful for my app. As it turned out, the “initialize global” block allowed me to host a long list that I could then access through the much simpler “get” block. I could then continue to use the “get” block within other functions, rather than deal with a 16 item list over and over again. This is especially useful when utilizing a list over multiple other functions, because it saves time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My app was not complicated by any means. It only required a total of two different “buildings” of blocks: the first specified what the single button on my app would do (select a random item from a specified list), and the other held the information for the list that was being randomized (a 16 item list of original songs). I’d like at some point to also figure out a way for items on the list that have already been displayed to be removed from the list so that songs won’t show up more than once, but so far I have had no success. I’m entirely confident it’s possible to do, I just have to figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>My First Impression of App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/ryan/2015/09/my</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever caught yourself thinking “I wish there was an app for that”? Maybe you wished there was a one-click rimshot on your phone to punctuate your bad jokes, or perhaps you’ve always wanted an interactive grocery list that knows all your favorite foods so you don’t have to write them down every time. At this point, let’s be honest: that app probably already exists. Just use your Google Play store and run a search, you’ll probably find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if your search yields no results? What if your app hasn’t already been created? What if your idea is so original, no one has thought to make anything like it before? Well, in that case, you’re in luck, because there’s a simple way to build that app yourself and it doesn’t require years of software engineering experience or schooling. All it requires is putting blocks together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT App Inventor is an innovative beginner&#039;s introduction to programming and app creation for Android that transforms the complex language of text-based coding into visual, drag-and-drop building blocks. The simplistic graphical interface grants even an inexperienced novice the ability to create a basic, fully functional app within an hour or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limits of MIT App Inventor are established only by the imagination of the user. While the format&#039;s simplicity allows newcomers to easily understand the basics of programming, it does not inhibit more advanced app creation; children and professionals alike can take advantage of App Inventor&#039;s potential. Whether it&#039;s something simple like creating an app that reminds you you&#039;re beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sNjGAiOrX-o&quot;&gt;any time you take a picture&lt;/a&gt;, or something more complex like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Arjuninventor/lateralogics-launches-locatera-pro-the-most-innovative-mobile-app-solution-to-track-children-in-38f54709b081&quot;&gt;tracking bus and student information&lt;/a&gt;, MIT App Inventor supplies the necessary building blocks to create any app imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the game-like quality of MIT App Inventor’s block-based construction process, the program is highly conducive to engaging young audiences and encouraging them to transition from consumers of technology to creators of it. Children from all over the world are picking up the program with no knowledge of software engineering and constructing &lt;a href=&quot;http://medford.wickedlocal.com/article/20150817/NEWS/150817161&quot;&gt;incredible apps&lt;/a&gt;. One group of students from Los Fresnos, Texas was invited to the 2014 White House Science Fair for the development of an app entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/article_d68ff3de-e227-11e3-8ae3-0017a43b2370.html&quot;&gt;Hello, Navi!&lt;/a&gt; This app was designed to assist the visually impaired in navigating their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether building practical apps geared toward helping a great deal of people with everyday challenges, or just finding news ways to make people smile, MIT App Inventor has limitless potential for users of all skill levels. With nearly 3 millions users in 195 countries having created over 7 million apps to date, the numbers are only growing, and based on the results so far that can only mean great things for the future of MIT App Inventor, and for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Exciting News from Boise State University</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/adminexplore/2015-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just heard some very exciting news from our good friend Yu-Chang Hsu at Boise State University:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Science Foundation Directorate of Education and Human Resources has awarded Boise State University a $163,660 supplemental funding grant to support using App Inventor to help STEM students learn trigonometry by developing their own math learning apps through team-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project title is, &quot;Boise State University Pilot: Using Student-Developed Apps to Frame Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Learning.&quot; The interdisciplinary project team includes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Bullock (Department of Mathematics)&lt;br /&gt;
Janet Callahan (Department of Materials Science and Engineering)&lt;br /&gt;
Yu-Hui Ching (Department of Educational Technology)&lt;br /&gt;
Yu-Chang Hsu (Department of Educational Technology)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students will learn to use App Inventor 2 to collaboratively develop apps that require applying trigonometry knowledge and help peers learn trigonometry. The students will use their own apps as refresher in the following advanced STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) courses. These apps will benefit the trigonometry class and other cohort of STEM students. The students will strengthen their math knowledge by applying it to app development with real-world impact, and engage in computational thinking as well as problem solving tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>
