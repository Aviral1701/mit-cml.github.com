Here’s a quick run down.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:16px; color:#3ebbbd; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;What is Youth Radio?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;YR is a media production company started in 1992 to offer young people a way to bring their voices to various media streams by creating content and engaging other youth through technology. YR offers practical course work in journalism, creative arts, digital photography, web design, social media, video production, technology, app development, and podcasts (to name a few). And as you can guess from the name, Youth Radio produces a weekly radio show with original content and topics relevant to today’s youth.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:16px; color:#3ebbbd; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;YR and MIT App Inventor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;YR takes creating content very seriously and they even developed an app to help them deliver their original content! Students created 5 different prototypes of an app and with the help of Google, MIT, and the University of San Francisco, narrowed down the many options to include the following functionality: story sharing, collecting media from listeners and a podcast rating system. Here are a few screenshots of the final product.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/Youth%20Radio%20App%20Screen%20Shot.png&quot; width=&quot;600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Download the &lt;a style=&quot;color: #3ebbbd; white-space: nowrap:&quot; href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_asha.YOUTHRADIOapp_BETA&quot;&gt;Youth Radio App Inventor App&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Play store and start tuning in!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:16px; color:#3ebbbd; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;App Making&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;The YR website offers links to app making tutorials suited for beginning, intermediate or advanced app developers. Doing tutorials is necessary when learning new technical skills, but what about when you want to venture off on your own to make an app from scratch? How in the world do you get started? Maybe you have no idea what to create or maybe you have too many ideas and can’t pick just one. YR has a &lt;a style=&quot;color: #3ebbbd; white-space: nowrap:&quot; href=&quot;https://youthradio.org/creative-studio/article/draft-diy-toolkit-how-to-come-up-with-your-own-mobile-app/&quot;&gt;DIY Toolkit &lt;/a&gt;to help you unravel the Mobile App Ideation process. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:16px; color:#3ebbbd; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Make a Hip Hop History App (you know you want to!)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-family:century gothic; font-size:13px; color:#3c3c3c; font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;This tutorial reviews the basics in case you’re a beginning coder and need a little introduction to App Inventor. Once you have the hang of navigating the App Inventor platform, the Hip Hop History App tutorial will have you diving in to uploading media, defining variables, creating lists, making a slider and creating a player. These tools will come in handy for any app you make and will most probably inspire you to create other apps that will display images, use audio samples, or make use of a slider.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Making the Hilltop Sunset App Part 1: Wheel-O-Songs, a List Randomizer</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/ryan/2015/09/making</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I built my very own original app on MIT App Inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a computer scientist, I’m not an expert programmer, and I’ve never taken any classes on the subject; I’m just a singer/songwriter with a degree in English and Creative Writing--and a dream. But even with literally zero knowledge of coding, MIT App Inventor’s simple building-block style (with the help of a handful of tutorials scattered about YouTube) allowed me to take a basic concept and turn it into a functional program within a little over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t start with any particularly revolutionary ideas; I just thought it would be fun to have a program that would randomly select one of my original songs at the push of a button. That way, if anyone ever wanted me to play something and inevitably couldn’t decide what, I could open this app, hit the button, and voila! An answer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking care of the app’s design was quick and simple: the display was shown immediately and a list of items--buttons, lists, images, etc.--was available for me to drag and drop, adding them instantly to my app and providing me with a list of options to customize how each item appeared on-screen. All I needed for my app was a single button that read “Wheel-O-Songs” and I was good to go. I changed the font color, background color, centered it, enlarged it, and was ready to work on making it a functional button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the language and functions of App Inventor did take some getting used to, fluency comes with practice. The majority of blocks are fairly easy to understand, provided you read them with the right mindset. In most instances the blocks read as normal English, but stripped down to only its essential, basic components. For example, there is a block that reads “When Button1 .Click, do _______,” and you can fill in the blank with any number of command blocks. Basically all that block means is, “When Button1 is clicked, it will perform the command ________.” I used this block in my app in conjunction with a “randomize list” command block so that when my Wheel-O-Songs button is clicked, it randomly selects an item from a specified list and changes the text of the button to the new selected item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly discovered the blocks are not always self-explanatory to newcomers. For instance, the “initialize global” block confused me at first, since I wasn’t familiar with the concept of global variables or what exactly that meant, or how it could be useful for my app. As it turned out, the “initialize global” block allowed me to host a long list that I could then access through the much simpler “get” block. I could then continue to use the “get” block within other functions, rather than deal with a 16 item list over and over again. This is especially useful when utilizing a list over multiple other functions, because it saves time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My app was not complicated by any means. It only required a total of two different “buildings” of blocks: the first specified what the single button on my app would do (select a random item from a specified list), and the other held the information for the list that was being randomized (a 16 item list of original songs). I’d like at some point to also figure out a way for items on the list that have already been displayed to be removed from the list so that songs won’t show up more than once, but so far I have had no success. I’m entirely confident it’s possible to do, I just have to figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>My First Impression of App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/ryan/2015/09/my</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever caught yourself thinking “I wish there was an app for that”? Maybe you wished there was a one-click rimshot on your phone to punctuate your bad jokes, or perhaps you’ve always wanted an interactive grocery list that knows all your favorite foods so you don’t have to write them down every time. At this point, let’s be honest: that app probably already exists. Just use your Google Play store and run a search, you’ll probably find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if your search yields no results? What if your app hasn’t already been created? What if your idea is so original, no one has thought to make anything like it before? Well, in that case, you’re in luck, because there’s a simple way to build that app yourself and it doesn’t require years of software engineering experience or schooling. All it requires is putting blocks together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT App Inventor is an innovative beginner&#039;s introduction to programming and app creation for Android that transforms the complex language of text-based coding into visual, drag-and-drop building blocks. The simplistic graphical interface grants even an inexperienced novice the ability to create a basic, fully functional app within an hour or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limits of MIT App Inventor are established only by the imagination of the user. While the format&#039;s simplicity allows newcomers to easily understand the basics of programming, it does not inhibit more advanced app creation; children and professionals alike can take advantage of App Inventor&#039;s potential. Whether it&#039;s something simple like creating an app that reminds you you&#039;re beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sNjGAiOrX-o&quot;&gt;any time you take a picture&lt;/a&gt;, or something more complex like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Arjuninventor/lateralogics-launches-locatera-pro-the-most-innovative-mobile-app-solution-to-track-children-in-38f54709b081&quot;&gt;tracking bus and student information&lt;/a&gt;, MIT App Inventor supplies the necessary building blocks to create any app imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the game-like quality of MIT App Inventor’s block-based construction process, the program is highly conducive to engaging young audiences and encouraging them to transition from consumers of technology to creators of it. Children from all over the world are picking up the program with no knowledge of software engineering and constructing &lt;a href=&quot;http://medford.wickedlocal.com/article/20150817/NEWS/150817161&quot;&gt;incredible apps&lt;/a&gt;. One group of students from Los Fresnos, Texas was invited to the 2014 White House Science Fair for the development of an app entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/article_d68ff3de-e227-11e3-8ae3-0017a43b2370.html&quot;&gt;Hello, Navi!&lt;/a&gt; This app was designed to assist the visually impaired in navigating their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether building practical apps geared toward helping a great deal of people with everyday challenges, or just finding news ways to make people smile, MIT App Inventor has limitless potential for users of all skill levels. With nearly 3 millions users in 195 countries having created over 7 million apps to date, the numbers are only growing, and based on the results so far that can only mean great things for the future of MIT App Inventor, and for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Exciting News from Boise State University</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/adminexplore/2015-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We just heard some very exciting news from our good friend Yu-Chang Hsu at Boise State University:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The National Science Foundation Directorate of Education and Human Resources has awarded Boise State University a $163,660 supplemental funding grant to support using App Inventor to help STEM students learn trigonometry by developing their own math learning apps through team-based learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The project title is, &quot;Boise State University Pilot: Using Student-Developed Apps to Frame Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Learning.&quot; The interdisciplinary project team includes,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doug Bullock (Department of Mathematics)&lt;br /&gt;
Janet Callahan (Department of Materials Science and Engineering)&lt;br /&gt;
Yu-Hui Ching (Department of Educational Technology)&lt;br /&gt;
Yu-Chang Hsu (Department of Educational Technology)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The students will learn to use App Inventor 2 to collaboratively develop apps that require applying trigonometry knowledge and help peers learn trigonometry. The students will use their own apps as refresher in the following advanced STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) courses. These apps will benefit the trigonometry class and other cohort of STEM students. The students will strengthen their math knowledge by applying it to app development with real-world impact, and engage in computational thinking as well as problem solving tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(184,0,92);&quot;&gt;MOSTEC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; (MIT Online Science, Technology, and Engineering Community) is a six-month program for eligible rising seniors offered through the MIT Office of Engineering Outreach Programs. It combines online curriculum with a week long on-site project-based workshop at MIT. One of the tracts offered was mobile app development with App Inventor! After 3 weeks of learning App Inventor online and one week of collaborative group work on campus, MOTSEC students presented their original app designs to an auditorium full of science and engineering enthusiasts. The results were quite impressive! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorites was created by Foli Amaizo who was tired of his friends at school having bad attitudes. He didn&#039;t want the negativity to get contagious, so he decided to built an app called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(184,0,92);&quot;&gt;Positivity&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Users can select from an array of positive messages to send to friends who may need a pick-me-up. Users can even set the timer to send texts on regular intervals. &lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-07%20at%2012.31.55%20PM.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 40%; margin-right: 1%;&quot; vspace=&quot;”40”&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another cool app called &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(184,0,92);&quot;&gt;Movie Crew&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; was made by a budding indie filmmaker who sought to provide resources for film sets. He said he has had trouble finding people willing to work as crew, so he wanted to create a database to offer available work opportunities. Next time you need a grip, gaffer, or an actor, check out Movie Crew.&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-07%20at%2012.32.04%20PM.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 40%; margin-right: 1%;&quot; vspace=&quot;”40”&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(184,0,92);&quot;&gt;Get Fit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is an app for busy people who have so much going on, they have trouble setting aside time to workout. This app provides four options: Cardio, Core, Lower Body and Stretching and then gives users a 5 minute intense workout program. Of course, users can input longer sessions as well. The Cardio option even has a Find Your Location button in case users are running on a new trail and get lost. &lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-07%20at%2012.31.20%20PM.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 40%; margin-right: 1%;&quot; vspace=&quot;”40”&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A savvy student decided to help others become financially responsible by creating an app to track saving money. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(184,0,92);&quot;&gt;My Piggy Bank&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; enables users to set a savings goal and see their progress. This tool is multi-functional and can encourage users to be more accountable and aware of their finances. &lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-07%20at%2012.32.22%20PM.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 40%; margin-right: 1%;&quot; vspace=&quot;”40”&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(184,0,92);&quot;&gt;Eventor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is a cool app that helps to publicize events. This could be used for any kind of gathering – a community service event, reunion, party, or study group to name a few. It is viewable as an app or online and shows listings of upcoming events. It also has an option where users can enter a friend&#039;s name and it will send the friend the URL of the Google Fusion Table where information can be entered into the database.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-07%20at%2012.32.56%20PM.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 40%; margin-right: 1%;&quot; vspace=&quot;”40”&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are stressed out, but don&#039;t feel like using your Get Fit app to ease tension, you can always use &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(184,0,92);&quot;&gt;Got 99 Problems: The Stress Reliever&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Users can shake their mobile device to see any of one of four games at random. The Test game allows users to get a 100% on a test simply by tapping on their screen. The Deadlines game challenges users to get an icon to a ball on the opposite side of the screen without touching any lines. Another game provides a pencil and blank slate, erasing the background reveals a positive message. And lastly, users can take a photo of whatever is in front of them, the image appears as the app background and then users can draw on it. Seems like the perfect way to diffuse stress! &lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/Screen%20Shot%202015-08-07%20at%2012.32.34%20PM.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 40%; margin-right: 1%;&quot; vspace=&quot;”40”&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title> App Inventor Extension Components available for testing</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2015/08/app</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT App Inventor team is delighted to announce the availability of Extension Components for testing. We hope the Extension Components will prove to be a major enhancement to App Inventor: Extensions provide a way for anyone to build their own App Inventor components, which others can then use in creating apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p .=&quot;&quot;&gt;
 App Inventor is free and open software, so people have always been able to build personal systems and install their own components. But until now, the only way to make those components available to others has been to create and maintain a personal App Inventor server that has those components built in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Extension components, in contrast, can be loaded dynamically into any App Inventor system, so they can be shared and imported into projects as needed. For example, educators and educational software developers to provide extension components tailored to specific lessons and activities, so that students can have these available in building apps. Examples might be simulations or tools for large-scale data analysis, or image recognition. Those features might be unfeasible to implement with the built-in App Inventor blocks, either because of processing speed or programming complexity. But the same capability might be readily implemented using extension components that encapsulate the necessary processing. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Anyone can create extension components. This requires gaining some familiarity with the App Inventor source code (located on Github) and programming in Java. Once you create an extension component, you can share it with anyone for use in their App Inventor projects. Extension components can be housed anywhere on the Web. They need not be stored at MIT or any other special place, although MIT hosts a repository where people can make extension components available for sharing and public use. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Today, we’re releasing a test server for App Inventor that supports the Extension Components feature. You can find it at extension-test.appinventor.mit.edu. There&#039;s also a document called App Inventor Extensions that explains how to create and use Extension Components. Once we&#039;ve accumulated enough feedback, we&#039;ll make extension components a regular part of App Inventor. With extensions, the range of App Inventor features can be expanded enormously. We hope that people will explore this tool to build new capabilities for App Inventor and their creations. 
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The implementation of App Inventor Extension Components is the work students who participated with the MIT App Inventor team in through Google Summer of Code: Ethan Hon, Justus Raju, and Mouhamadou Sall. Other summer GSoC App Inventor participants in 2015 are Devid Farinelli, Yucun Li, and Shruti Rijhwani. All of them are extraordinarily talented, and the entire App Inventor community is in their debt.

I am working to promote coding culture in my country by organizing workshops, presenting in conferences, making teaching resources ... I first used App Inventor in middle school and it was a great experience for kids to make different games using the feature of their devices like GPS or orientation sensors. In the beginning, people were thinking that App Inventor was just another version of Scratch but for the Android platform and mainly used for teaching kids how to code. But, this point of view changed quickly after seeing the possibilities offered by App Inventor. More over, App Inventor is seen now as the Android programming platform for non computer scientists.  I&#039;ve seen projects in Robotics and mathematics done by non-CS teachers and students in other fields. I see the translation process as offering new tools for my community and others to master technology and add value. My slogan is: Don&#039;t spend your time learning new programming languages, concentrate your effort on creation! &lt;/p&gt;

Since the curriculum utilized MIT App Inventor to create mobile apps, no prior coding experience was required! The application process was based on GPA, AP course work and an interest in mobile app technology. Students learned about app design through instructors, self-paced online curriculum, group work and guest speakers. At the end of the week, they collaborated in teams to create a Boston tourism app using the design-thinking process: &lt;strong&gt;Ideate &amp;gt; Plan &amp;gt; Calculate &amp;gt; Build&lt;/strong&gt;. Then, they pitched their apps designs to panels of tech experts. Just because the week is over, doesn&#039;t mean their app building is! App Academy attendees have the opportunity to submit their app ideas to win $20,000 in scholarships. Submissions are due in October and the App Inventor team is looking forward to seeing the winning designs!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;Noa (a rising senior pictured upper left) had this to say about her app academy experience:&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &quot;Surrounded by so many talented programmers and students at the academy, it was easy to feel like my skills didn&#039;t really fit in. I had no experience with the fundamental basics of computer science, and I had never taken apart video games as a child and used the parts to build a 3D printer. But the reality that had begun to take shape by the end of my experience at the app academy after spending a week transforming a vague idea into a tangible application that could impact the lives of people outside of my community using the App Inventor tools broadcasted a whole new theory for me about what technology meant. It became very clear that there is a very valuable place for people with less computer science based backgrounds in the world of technology and innovation. It is truly a remarkable thing that someone who has never before laid eyes on a programming language can build a product equally as brilliant and sophisticated as an application built by a person fluent in 3 programming languages. This is what MIT App Inventor and the app academy has allowed me to do. It has allowed me to see the strength that lies in pure innovation and the value that lies in having a revolutionary idea. I hope that many more students have the opportunity to discover that we all have the capacity to contribute to the world of technology and innovation. App Inventor has indeed taught me that there is not a day to waste on simply being a static consumer of the digital revolution.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
