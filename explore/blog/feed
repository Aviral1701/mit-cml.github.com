 <title>Hundreds Try App Inventor at MIT Open House</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/04-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/app-inventor-at-mit-open-house.jpeg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 45%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Over 40,000 people flocked to Cambridge on Saturday, April 23 to check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mit2016.mit.edu/openhouse&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT Under the Dome Open House&lt;/a&gt; event. Attendees were able to view over 380 exhibits around campus involving 80 different departments. The MIT App Inventor team was part of the CSAIL exhibit housed in a large white tent on North Court outside of the Stata Center. Visitors streamed through the tent all day long and hundreds of visitors came by the App Inventor table to learn more about App Inventor. A Digital Face Painting app was available on several tablets for visitors to try. The app allowed the user to take his/her picture, then draw on the picture to simulate face painting. By pressing a Send button, the face images were uploaded to a web server for display on a large monitor. Visitors were also able to get a printed copy of their digital face painting art to take home with them. Thanks to Lyn Turbak and Eni Mustafaraj of Wellesley College who shared their app with us. Thanks also to Jeff Schiller of MIT for creating the server space for uploading of images.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Most of the visitors had not heard of App Inventor, so were very curious to learn more and and to understand the possibilities. Many were surprised at how easy it is to become an app creator, instead of just an app user.
&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>The Tech Girls of Dharavi Slum, Mahim, Mumbai, India</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/04/tech</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest blog by the Dharavi Tech Girls&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is Anu. I was born in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharavi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nayanagar, Dharavi slum neighborhood&lt;/a&gt;, Mahim, Mumbai. I am the first generation from my family to go to school. I lost my father in 2013 in a road accident when I was 12 years old. My mother works as a domestic helper. There are many girls in our neighborhood who face a lot of hardships and problems like domestic violence, abuse, “eve teasing” (sexual harassment), child marriage, etc. This neighborhood is one of the most notorious pockets of the slum where drug abuse, domestic violence, child abuse, child marriage etc. is very frequent. We didn’t have dreams and aspirations until the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/sluminnovation/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Slum Innovation Project&lt;/a&gt; started in our neighborhood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/dharavi1.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 40%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In January, 2014, the Slum Innovation Project was started in Nayanagar, Dharavi slum neighborhood, Mahim, Mumbai by Nawneet Ranjan who uses Story and Technology to empower girls and women to become &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/WI0tPLjt8N4&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Change Makers&lt;/a&gt;. Anu, Roshani, Sapna, Mahek, Rani, Fauziya, Zaberi, Deepali, Savita, Rani and many more joined Slum Innovation Project where they were introduced to the role of stories in personal narrative and how using technology can make a paradigm shift and also challenge the status quo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/dharavi2.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 10px; width: 40%;&quot; /&gt;Mr. Nawneet introduced us to this STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts &amp;amp; Mathematics) Program in our neighborhood. Slowly we started to learn computer science and coding. We were introduced to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;MIT App Inventor&lt;/a&gt; platform. We attended a Leadership and Technology for Social Good workshop. Under Mr. Nawneet’s mentorship, we made a list of problems in our community and decided to work in separate groups on the  MIT App Inventor platform to create our mobile applications to solve community problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2015, we published our first mobile app, &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appinventor.ai_girlsforchangefromdharavi.WomenFightBack&amp;amp;hl=en&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Women Fight Back&lt;/a&gt;, on the Google Play store. We are engaging our community to use this app to address the problem of women’s security. It has started to help our sisters and mothers. Slowly, the amount of eve teasing and domestic violence is decreasing. We will keep working to reach out to more people from the different communities to solve the problem of violence against women, girls and children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have made prototypes of apps that address the problems of water collection, girls’ education, community cleanliness, child labour, etc. We are working on these prototypes now to make them work better and eventually publish them in the Google Play store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/dharavi3.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto; width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In January, 2016 there was a fire in our neighborhood and many of the girls lost everything. We are reaching out through our &lt;a href=&quot;https://igg.me/at/FXBJikrNBfE&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;crowd funding campaign&lt;/a&gt; to get the materials we need to rebuild our lives and continue to pursue our dreams of using technology to better our communities. It will be great if you could share and spread the word about our campaign. We have already raised 75 percent of our goal. Help us to reach our goal and realize our potential. Let’s together make this Story of Change successful. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>A Great Initiative to Teach App inventor in Bangla By Niloy Shuvo</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/04/great</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest blog by Anisul Haque&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/shikkhok.PNG&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.shikkhok.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SHIKKHOK.COM&lt;/a&gt;, a well known platform for teaching in the Bengali language, won a 2013 Google Rise Award, 2013 The Bobs user award, ISIF Award and so on. SHIKKHOK means Teacher in English. For 3 years this website has provided important lessons on various important topics. Ragib Hasan, Assistant Professor of Computer Security, University of Alabama at Birmingham, started this platform, shikkhok.com. Now this platform is very popular in Bangladesh and West Bengal, India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A year ago a medical student, Niloy Sharma Shuvo, started a course on App Inventor to increase interest in young people about programming and making apps that will help in their workplace, school and college. The people of Bangladesh and West Bengal, India have many ideas, but many of them have no idea how to build app, or how to put their idea into action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course has 11 lectures based on a good syllabus. This is the first initiative on App Inventor for Bengali speaking people. About 1500 students registered for the course. They are interested in making apps with their own ideas. This course planted an interest in programming and increased problem solving skills in students in schools, colleges, and also universities.&lt;br /&gt;
Using quality video tutorials, the teacher of this course, Niloy Sharma Shuvo, introduced MIT App Inventor to the students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This course centers on real projects and there are some lectures/tutorials on making mini games. Teenagers are attracted by this option. Many young people build games and upload them to the Google Play store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very basic examples of how App Inventor visual components work, along with downloadable App Inventor real project files. This initiative helped many young people to develop their own apps. After the course, he also helped students with their own projects, or explained the function of components by email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The impact of this online course on Bangladesh is noticeable. Some students have shared their story of winning science fairs, and many competed in national competitions by making apps with App Inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One student who is studying in Dhaka University said &quot; Now I can make my own apps though I don&#039;t have a little knowledge of programming. I&#039;m not a CSE student but I made an app &#039;Class Note&#039; where I can save my lecture notes. The course on shikkhok.com about App Inventor guided me to build my app with my own idea.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-blog-images field-type-image field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;

 <title>App Inventor part of Science on Saturday at MIT</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/04/app-0</link>

Over 1000 people attended the event, which featured on-stage demos by various EECS faculty and staff on electricity, energy, motion and App Inventor. After the on-stage demos, visitors were able to try hands-on demos in the lobby of the auditorium. Karen Lang and Aubrey Colter from the MIT App Inventor team demonstrated how to create simple apps and assisted young people trying App Inventor for the first time. The youngest app inventor was four years old! More pictures of the event can be seen &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.eecs.mit.edu/news-events/media/science-saturday-circuits-and-computers&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.

 <title>App Inventor Clicker App Makes a Difference in the Classroom</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/04/app</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest blog post by Ken Masters, of Sultan Qaboos University in Oman&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;All photos courtesy of Salim Al-Harthi&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/clicker-app-being-used.png&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto; width: 95%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both&quot;&gt;
I had to make quite big changes to the way in which I presented my course, and the end result was delivering 2-hour lectures to a class of 150+ students. Some problems:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/clicker-app.png&quot; style=&quot;float: right; width: 30%; margin-left: 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;li&gt;How to keep variations in teaching methods and student engagement for 2 hours with such a large class?  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As I move through the lesson, how to ensure that the students are following me (without asking a general &quot;do you understand&quot;, which will just get a universal nod, and without asking individual students,, which would be embarrassing for them if they were lost.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Quite a bit of the stuff was in the text book, but harder technical stuff interspersed with easier stuff (most of my students are not mother-tongue English speakers).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
I decided to go for clicker technology, but that introduced its own problem: No budget, and no clickers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Mm. So I wrote a simple clicker app in App Inventor that utilizes Fusion Tables. I can now intersperse my lecture with various questions, and display the results to the class (using charts drawn in the fusion Table area), and get a quick handle on the students&#039; understanding. It&#039;s also anonymous (I collect no id info),  and so those who are struggling and getting any questions wrong can still participate without feeling silly in front of the large class, and can quickly gauge their own level of understanding as the class progresses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/class-with-google-hangout.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; width: 30%; margin-right: 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I had to go away urgently during the semester, and there was a lecture that I simply could not re-schedule, so I gave it live using Google Hangouts with the video feed of me and my presentation. The advantage of the app over clickers was that, from 5,000 kms (3,100 miles) away, I was still able to use my app with the questions, because the students&#039; answers were simply being sent to the Fusion Table via wifi, and I could display those charts to them in the same way that I was displaying the presentation. It took about 5 mins of my practising moving between screens beforehand, but, once I had the knack of it, it was straight-forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-blog-images field-type-image field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;

 <title>BusBudE Secure Travel Notification System</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/04</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest blog post by the BusBudE team, South Fayette Township School District, Pennsylvania&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;width: 55%; margin: auto; display: block; padding-top: 20px;&quot;&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;b&gt;Every problem has its solution. You just have to be creative enough to find it.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;Each year nationwide, there are reports of young children being dropped off of school buses in the wrong neighborhoods, unable to find their way home, and widespread reports in the media of children who are inadvertently left on the bus alone, posing a dangerous health risk. Most children live in households where families work, making it difficult for parents to be home to ensure the safe departure and arrival of their children. School notification systems contact parents during the first hours of school if their child has an unreported absence. Parents often are not aware if their children have returned home at the appropriate time until parents discover them missing hours later. The significant lapse in time can mean the difference between life and death. We put our creativity to the test to find a solution for this problem and created BusBudE Secure Travel Notification System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the BusBudE Team, middle school and high school students from South Fayette Township School District near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Each member has their own individual role and duty that helps our team stay organized and efficient. Our team includes: Co-project Managers: Joe Cavanaugh (grade: 11), Parv Shrivastava (grade: 8); Director of Computer Programming: Sam Cohen (grade: 11); Computer Programming Team: Anish Thangavelu (grade: 8), Vinay Pedapati (grade: 9); and Director of Business Marketing: Meghan Banerjee (grade: 12). We are part of the Emerging Innovation Leaders Program led by South Fayette’s Director of Technology and Innovation, Aileen Owens. Our goal for BusBudE is to create a system that helps young students board the bus safely and allows parents peace of mind knowing their child is safe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BusBudE is a product designed to help keep students safe while traveling to and from school on the school bus. Currently we are beta testing our product design. Our plan for the future is to create system for parents to register their young children for this service. Currently during beta testing our children receive a tag and small device attached to their backpack. As children enter the bus they scan their BusBudE tag to the mobile device on the bus. Immediately a text message is sent to the child’s parents alerting them as to the date, time, and location that their child enters and leaves the bus. Parents know exactly where their children are when they enter and exit the bus. The BusBude application is designed to increase students’ safety and decrease parents’ fears and apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical Aspects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-screenshot.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right; margin-left: 10px;&quot; /&gt;BusBudE uses a variety of technology within a cohesive system to keep children safe.  Currently, the major components of BusBudE are near field communication (NFC) tags and a NFC-capable phone.  We envision every bus outfitted with a phone that has NFC capabilities. Each participating student will receive a tag with customized information specific to each child and a custom designed tag holder. When the students enter the bus, they will scan their NFC tag to the NFC reader on the phone. Each phone is loaded with the BusBudE application which takes in the student’s information and puts it into a text that is sent to his or her parents.  Here is an example of a text message:  Sara is getting off bus 10 at 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We designed the prototype app for BusBudE using App Inventor. The app has a variety of features. The features include an accurate location and time based algorithm that detects whether the student is getting on or off the bus in the morning or the afternoon.  With this algorithm, bus drivers do not have to manually select whether a student is getting on or off the bus as we did in an earlier iteration.  Additionally, a notification sounds when the phone as read the tag to notify the student if his or her NFC tag has been scanned, a necessary feature that we added after our first beta test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featured below is a small snippet of the code that takes the name of the student and phone number from the NFC tag.  It shows the BusBudE logo and a counter that increases by 1 every time the student has scanned their tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-blocks.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design Stages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we designed the prototype version of the device and programmed the tags and the reader, we decided to beta test the application with a small group of students and their parents. We selected 5 students in 1st and 2nd grade from Bus 10 and ran the first beta test in March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-diagram.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right; width: 30%; margin-left: 10px;&quot; /&gt;The test concentrated on specific research questions to help develop the app to meet our user needs. We focused on analyzing the technical facets of the device and the students’ responses. The questions we focused on included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would the technical aspects of the device work effectively and efficiently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would there be any time restraints or issues scanning and receiving text messages? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would the device be easy for the students to use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We held a parent-student training session with five students and their parents from 1st and 2nd grade to explain exactly what the product was intended to do. After distributing the individual badges, we ran through a practice run with the students to set expectations and explain how to scan their badges through role-playing. During the first beta test the device had the capacity to send a text to the student’s parent or guardian with a notification to let parents know that their childe had entered or exited the bus. We provided training for the bus driver and with her assistance located the best placement for the device on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-team.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left; margin-right: 10px;&quot; /&gt;On the morning and afternoon of the beta test, Aileen Owens rode the bus and monitored the students, observing and taking notes. After each alert was received, parents texted back to Aileen’s cell phone to let her know that they received the alert. She could then see in real time when students scanned and when the text was received. Parents reported that they received the texts and provided enthusiastic and positive feedback. The first beta test was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the lessons we learned from this beta test were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scanning cards was easy for the students and was accomplished quickly without significant delay to the bus schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reading device on the bus was positioned right for the elementary school children to scan without difficulty. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parents really loved the fact that they were receiving texts that alerted them to the fact that their children were safely riding the bus at the right times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential areas for improvement were also discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was no visual cue on the reading device that allowed students to see that their card had been scanned. As a result, some students scanned multiple times since they were not sure if their scan had been completed. As a result, some parents received multiple text messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another area for improvement was the handling of the reading device on the bus. The Bus driver suggested that the device be switched on at the start of the route and switched off at the end of the route, so that the driver did not have to touch the device at any time during the trip. If the driver were to touch the device anytime in between, it could potentially send repeat messages to parents, and cause confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The driver also recommended that the text message sends an alert to parents stating the bus number that the students entered. She explained that one of the biggest challenges for elementary students is learning to board the correct bus. There are times that students take a different bus route home from school when traveling to parents living in separate households.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;
The first beta test presented us with several areas for improvement which we incorporated into the second iteration of the product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The responses and results of this test were reported to Josh Sheldon, an App Inventor team member from MIT. One of his suggestions was to program the device to include the location of the student when entering and exiting the bus. Josh explained to the team how to use the location sensor feature on the App Inventor program.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The team made this addition to the device, upgraded to a higher data plan, and tested the second iteration of the program through a second beta test. This beta test was also successful.  Our team began preparing to expand the device to accommodate more students, and to make adjustments to the badge size and look, with the idea of theoretically scaling-up for implementation for our school transportation department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beta Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-screenshot2.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot; /&gt;After the original beta test that took place in mid-2015 with children in grades K-2, the BusbudE team took the opportunity to test an alternate use of the design and to consider product flexibility. South Fayette belongs to Digital Promise, League of Innovative Schools, a nationwide organization designed to accelerate innovation in education. The League hosts meetings twice a year in different parts of the country. In October 2015 they chose to host their meeting in Pittsburgh and visit three League schools including South Fayette. Our BusBudE team prepared 70 tags for visitors. Each visitor was assigned to one of four groups and each group followed a different schedule for the day. When visitors entered the bus to travel from downtown Pittsburgh to South Fayette they scanned their tags and their specific schedule, as well as information and web site links about South Fayette’s computational thinking and STEAM program, was texted to their phone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
This beta test of the product provided excellent results. We were able to show that BusBudE could be adapted and configured for other uses. From this beta test we were able to move through another iteration of the application and promptly moved back to development for the intended age group in order to complete a larger beta test in early 2016.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The beta test that was completed in March 2016 included 38 students in 1st – 5th grade riding Bus 10. This beta test was a user-centered interaction test with a larger population specifically designed for the following reasons. We changed the plastic 3D printing device that holds the NFC tag and needed to discover: (1) were the devices designed appropriately for small hands, (2) could students use the device effectively, (3) would larger numbers of students scanning tags significantly delay or affect the bus schedule, and (4) to discover any additional challenges or obstacles that must be addressed. During this third test, we encountered our first issue with the system. In the morning students scanned when entering the bus but their parents did not receive the text alert. However, the afternoon test worked well. Parents received the text alerts when students entered and exited the bus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
From this test we learned that we need to build a failsafe system into the BusBudE application. We realize that before the phone was attached to the bus it was dropped down several stairs of the bus. The phone must have turned off but because of the way the case was designed there was no way to visually see that the phone was disconnected. The team is working on a re-design to address this issue. In addition, the team is working on a way to design the app so that students can scan without touching the device to make the scanning process faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future of BusBudE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Currently BusBudE is in its beta stages, thus there are many aspects that need to be altered and adapted before our product can truly be finished.  In terms of upgrading our system, we would like to integrate a clear light and sound indication for the students.  This would allow them to recognize if their tag scanned and if they are on the correct bus by using a green light and a sound notification for the correct bus and a red light with a sound alert if they are on the wrong bus.  We are also looking into the addition of an external display indicating the status of the scanned NFC tag as a solution to this problem.  Also, we are currently working to edit our code to enable more features such as precise GPS location notification and to further enhance the reach of the application. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The NFC tags we had purchased for previous beta tests weren&#039;t cost effective and were a temporary solution, thus we have started collaborating with an Australian based start-up to lower costs for mass orders and integrate our logo onto each tag.  We currently use a phone for our NFC scanner, yet in future iterations we would like to change it to a customized scanner specifically for BusBudE to include increased proximity and reliability.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We have already conducted several beta tests, yet with every revision to BusBudE we would like to hold at least one beta test to observe the effect of each specific change in our product. In the future we hope to include full functionality and use of the application serving every student within the South Fayette School District.  From this point, assuming the implementation is successful, we would like to begin to expand to other districts and potentially become an entrepreneurship venture.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Welcome 30 New Master Trainers in Mobile Educational Computing</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/josh/2016/03-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blogs/master_trainers_group.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had an spectacular experience this past week – we had 30 people, from 18 countries, come together to be trained as MIT Master Trainers in Mobile Educational Computing (with MIT App Inventor), put together jointly with the MIT Professional Education Short Programs group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with the amazing folks who’ve been master trainers with the Verizon program, we now have ~40 Master Trainers, &amp; they are wonderful - we will soon have a full listing of these folks and their contact information so you can begin to take advantage of their awesome skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Huge thanks and congratulations to Karen Lang and Marsha Gordon and her Short Programs staff, all of whom did an enormous amount of work for this, and to Dave Wolber, who flew cross country and provided amazing guidance and instruction. Thanks as always to Hal, for his leadership and inspired opening talk. And of course, thanks to Jeff &amp; Andrew for their presentations &amp; answers to MANY questions. Thanks too, to Cynthia Solomon, for her inspiration, guidance, and thoughtful presentation. And without Marisol Diaz, we wouldn’t have had the logistics or amazing reception on Thursday evening. Finally, thanks to Mel Robinson for making sure all the final details were taken care of.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Altona Middle School Team Builds Diction Defender App</title>

They were beginning their App Inventor training to learn the skills necessary to develop their app, Diction Defender, over the next few months. In the morning, MIT Master Trainer, Ann Root, took the students through the storyboarding process where the students designed the order and layout of the various app screens. The afternoon was spent working directly with App Inventor. Each student worked on a separate App Inventor tutorials, each with a different focus or feature. Then the students came together to share what they have learned with the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/denver2.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%; margin-right: 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The app is intended to help students become better writers by leading them through a game that features a series of grammar questions with increasing degrees of difficulty. The game theme is a journey through different landscapes on an island, with pitfalls if the user answers incorrectly. Their mentor and computer science teacher, Mollie Kelleher, a former English teacher, is helping the team with the grammar side of things. The game is highly visual, so the artistic abilities of team members will be a big part of the user interface. There are some tricky technical algorithms for the students to work out, but they appear to be up for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The enthusiasm and energy was high as the students began what will be an intensive few months of development. In June, they will present their app at National TSA Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. It was a great experience to see this team in action and I look forward to seeing and playing Diction Defender in June. &lt;/p&gt;
