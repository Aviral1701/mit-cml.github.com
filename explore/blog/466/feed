 <title>Making the Hilltop Sunset App Part 1: Wheel-O-Songs, a List Randomizer</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/ryan/2015/09/making</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today I built my very own original app on MIT App Inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not a computer scientist, I’m not an expert programmer, and I’ve never taken any classes on the subject; I’m just a singer/songwriter with a degree in English and Creative Writing--and a dream. But even with literally zero knowledge of coding, MIT App Inventor’s simple building-block style (with the help of a handful of tutorials scattered about YouTube) allowed me to take a basic concept and turn it into a functional program within a little over an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I didn’t start with any particularly revolutionary ideas; I just thought it would be fun to have a program that would randomly select one of my original songs at the push of a button. That way, if anyone ever wanted me to play something and inevitably couldn’t decide what, I could open this app, hit the button, and voila! An answer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking care of the app’s design was quick and simple: the display was shown immediately and a list of items--buttons, lists, images, etc.--was available for me to drag and drop, adding them instantly to my app and providing me with a list of options to customize how each item appeared on-screen. All I needed for my app was a single button that read “Wheel-O-Songs” and I was good to go. I changed the font color, background color, centered it, enlarged it, and was ready to work on making it a functional button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though the language and functions of App Inventor did take some getting used to, fluency comes with practice. The majority of blocks are fairly easy to understand, provided you read them with the right mindset. In most instances the blocks read as normal English, but stripped down to only its essential, basic components. For example, there is a block that reads “When Button1 .Click, do _______,” and you can fill in the blank with any number of command blocks. Basically all that block means is, “When Button1 is clicked, it will perform the command ________.” I used this block in my app in conjunction with a “randomize list” command block so that when my Wheel-O-Songs button is clicked, it randomly selects an item from a specified list and changes the text of the button to the new selected item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quickly discovered the blocks are not always self-explanatory to newcomers. For instance, the “initialize global” block confused me at first, since I wasn’t familiar with the concept of global variables or what exactly that meant, or how it could be useful for my app. As it turned out, the “initialize global” block allowed me to host a long list that I could then access through the much simpler “get” block. I could then continue to use the “get” block within other functions, rather than deal with a 16 item list over and over again. This is especially useful when utilizing a list over multiple other functions, because it saves time and space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My app was not complicated by any means. It only required a total of two different “buildings” of blocks: the first specified what the single button on my app would do (select a random item from a specified list), and the other held the information for the list that was being randomized (a 16 item list of original songs). I’d like at some point to also figure out a way for items on the list that have already been displayed to be removed from the list so that songs won’t show up more than once, but so far I have had no success. I’m entirely confident it’s possible to do, I just have to figure it out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>My First Impression of App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/ryan/2015/09/my</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you ever caught yourself thinking “I wish there was an app for that”? Maybe you wished there was a one-click rimshot on your phone to punctuate your bad jokes, or perhaps you’ve always wanted an interactive grocery list that knows all your favorite foods so you don’t have to write them down every time. At this point, let’s be honest: that app probably already exists. Just use your Google Play store and run a search, you’ll probably find what you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if your search yields no results? What if your app hasn’t already been created? What if your idea is so original, no one has thought to make anything like it before? Well, in that case, you’re in luck, because there’s a simple way to build that app yourself and it doesn’t require years of software engineering experience or schooling. All it requires is putting blocks together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MIT App Inventor is an innovative beginner&#039;s introduction to programming and app creation for Android that transforms the complex language of text-based coding into visual, drag-and-drop building blocks. The simplistic graphical interface grants even an inexperienced novice the ability to create a basic, fully functional app within an hour or less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The limits of MIT App Inventor are established only by the imagination of the user. While the format&#039;s simplicity allows newcomers to easily understand the basics of programming, it does not inhibit more advanced app creation; children and professionals alike can take advantage of App Inventor&#039;s potential. Whether it&#039;s something simple like creating an app that reminds you you&#039;re beautiful &lt;a href=&quot;https://youtu.be/sNjGAiOrX-o&quot;&gt;any time you take a picture&lt;/a&gt;, or something more complex like &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@Arjuninventor/lateralogics-launches-locatera-pro-the-most-innovative-mobile-app-solution-to-track-children-in-38f54709b081&quot;&gt;tracking bus and student information&lt;/a&gt;, MIT App Inventor supplies the necessary building blocks to create any app imaginable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because of the game-like quality of MIT App Inventor’s block-based construction process, the program is highly conducive to engaging young audiences and encouraging them to transition from consumers of technology to creators of it. Children from all over the world are picking up the program with no knowledge of software engineering and constructing &lt;a href=&quot;http://medford.wickedlocal.com/article/20150817/NEWS/150817161&quot;&gt;incredible apps&lt;/a&gt;. One group of students from Los Fresnos, Texas was invited to the 2014 White House Science Fair for the development of an app entitled &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/local/article_d68ff3de-e227-11e3-8ae3-0017a43b2370.html&quot;&gt;Hello, Navi!&lt;/a&gt; This app was designed to assist the visually impaired in navigating their school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether building practical apps geared toward helping a great deal of people with everyday challenges, or just finding news ways to make people smile, MIT App Inventor has limitless potential for users of all skill levels. With nearly 3 millions users in 195 countries having created over 7 million apps to date, the numbers are only growing, and based on the results so far that can only mean great things for the future of MIT App Inventor, and for the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>
