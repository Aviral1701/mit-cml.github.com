&lt;div style=&quot;width: 50%; margin: auto; display: block;&quot;&gt;
&lt;cite&gt;&lt;q&gt;Every problem has its solution. You just have to be creative enough to find it.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;clear:both;&quot;&gt;Each year nationwide, there are reports of young children being dropped off of school buses in the wrong neighborhoods, unable to find their way home, and widespread reports in the media of children who are inadvertently left on the bus alone, posing a dangerous health risk. Most children live in households where families work, making it difficult for parents to be home to ensure the safe departure and arrival of their children. School notification systems contact parents during the first hours of school if their child has an unreported absence. Parents often are not aware if their children have returned home at the appropriate time until parents discover them missing hours later. The significant lapse in time can mean the difference between life and death. We put our creativity to the test to find a solution for this problem and created BusBudE Secure Travel Notification System.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are the BusBudE Team, middle school and high school students from South Fayette Township School District near Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Each member has their own individual role and duty that helps our team stay organized and efficient. Our team includes: Co-project Managers: Joe Cavanaugh (grade: 11), Parv Shrivastava (grade: 8); Director of Computer Programming: Sam Cohen (grade: 11); Computer Programming Team: Anish Thangavelu (grade: 8), Vinay Pedapati (grade: 9); and Director of Business Marketing: Meghan Banerjee (grade: 12). We are part of the Emerging Innovation Leaders Program led by South Fayette’s Director of Technology and Innovation, Aileen Owens. Our goal for BusBudE is to create a system that helps young students board the bus safely and allows parents peace of mind knowing their child is safe.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BusBudE is a product designed to help keep students safe while traveling to and from school on the school bus. Currently we are beta testing our product design. Our plan for the future is to create system for parents to register their young children for this service. Currently during beta testing our children receive a tag and small device attached to their backpack. As children enter the bus they scan their BusBudE tag to the mobile device on the bus. Immediately a text message is sent to the child’s parents alerting them as to the date, time, and location that their child enters and leaves the bus. Parents know exactly where their children are when they enter and exit the bus. The BusBude application is designed to increase students’ safety and decrease parents’ fears and apprehension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Technical Aspects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-screenshot.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right;&quot; /&gt;BusBudE uses a variety of technology within a cohesive system to keep children safe.  Currently, the major components of BusBudE are near field communication (NFC) tags and a NFC-capable phone.  We envision every bus outfitted with a phone that has NFC capabilities. Each participating student will receive a tag with customized information specific to each child and a custom designed tag holder. When the students enter the bus, they will scan their NFC tag to the NFC reader on the phone. Each phone is loaded with the BusBudE application which takes in the student’s information and puts it into a text that is sent to his or her parents.  Here is an example of a text message:  Sara is getting off bus 10 at 77 Massachusetts Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
We designed the prototype app for BusBudE using App Inventor. The app has a variety of features. The features include an accurate location and time based algorithm that detects whether the student is getting on or off the bus in the morning or the afternoon.  With this algorithm, bus drivers do not have to manually select whether a student is getting on or off the bus as we did in an earlier iteration.  Additionally, a notification sounds when the phone as read the tag to notify the student if his or her NFC tag has been scanned, a necessary feature that we added after our first beta test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Featured below is a small snippet of the code that takes the name of the student and phone number from the NFC tag.  It shows the BusBudE logo and a counter that increases by 1 every time the student has scanned their tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-blocks.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Design Stages&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once we designed the prototype version of the device and programmed the tags and the reader, we decided to beta test the application with a small group of students and their parents. We selected 5 students in 1st and 2nd grade from Bus 10 and ran the first beta test in March 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-diagram.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right;&quot; /&gt;The test concentrated on specific research questions to help develop the app to meet our user needs. We focused on analyzing the technical facets of the device and the students’ responses. The questions we focused on included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Would the technical aspects of the device work effectively and efficiently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would there be any time restraints or issues scanning and receiving text messages? &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would the device be easy for the students to use?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We held a parent-student training session with five students and their parents from 1st and 2nd grade to explain exactly what the product was intended to do. After distributing the individual badges, we ran through a practice run with the students to set expectations and explain how to scan their badges through role-playing. During the first beta test the device had the capacity to send a text to the student’s parent or guardian with a notification to let parents know that their childe had entered or exited the bus. We provided training for the bus driver and with her assistance located the best placement for the device on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-team.png&quot; style=&quot;float:left;&quot; /&gt;On the morning and afternoon of the beta test, Aileen Owens rode the bus and monitored the students, observing and taking notes. After each alert was received, parents texted back to Aileen’s cell phone to let her know that they received the alert. She could then see in real time when students scanned and when the text was received. Parents reported that they received the texts and provided enthusiastic and positive feedback. The first beta test was a success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the lessons we learned from this beta test were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Scanning cards was easy for the students and was accomplished quickly without significant delay to the bus schedule.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The reading device on the bus was positioned right for the elementary school children to scan without difficulty. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The parents really loved the fact that they were receiving texts that alerted them to the fact that their children were safely riding the bus at the right times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Potential areas for improvement were also discovered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There was no visual cue on the reading device that allowed students to see that their card had been scanned. As a result, some students scanned multiple times since they were not sure if their scan had been completed. As a result, some parents received multiple text messages.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Another area for improvement was the handling of the reading device on the bus. The Bus driver suggested that the device be switched on at the start of the route and switched off at the end of the route, so that the driver did not have to touch the device at any time during the trip. If the driver were to touch the device anytime in between, it could potentially send repeat messages to parents, and cause confusion.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The driver also recommended that the text message sends an alert to parents stating the bus number that the students entered. She explained that one of the biggest challenges for elementary students is learning to board the correct bus. There are times that students take a different bus route home from school when traveling to parents living in separate households.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first beta test presented us with several areas for improvement which we incorporated into the second iteration of the product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responses and results of this test were reported to Josh Sheldon, an App Inventor team member from MIT. One of his suggestions was to program the device to include the location of the student when entering and exiting the bus. Josh explained to the team how to use the location sensor feature on the App Inventor program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team made this addition to the device, upgraded to a higher data plan, and tested the second iteration of the program through a second beta test. This beta test was also successful.  Our team began preparing to expand the device to accommodate more students, and to make adjustments to the badge size and look, with the idea of theoretically scaling-up for implementation for our school transportation department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Beta Tests&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-screenshot2.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot; /&gt;After the original beta test that took place in mid-2015 with children in grades K-2, the BusbudE team took the opportunity to test an alternate use of the design and to consider product flexibility. South Fayette belongs to Digital Promise, League of Innovative Schools, a nationwide organization designed to accelerate innovation in education. The League hosts meetings twice a year in different parts of the country. In October 2015 they chose to host their meeting in Pittsburgh and visit three League schools including South Fayette. Our BusBudE team prepared 70 tags for visitors. Each visitor was assigned to one of four groups and each group followed a different schedule for the day. When visitors entered the bus to travel from downtown Pittsburgh to South Fayette they scanned their tags and their specific schedule, as well as information and web site links about South Fayette’s computational thinking and STEAM program, was texted to their phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This beta test of the product provided excellent results. We were able to show that BusBudE could be adapted and configured for other uses. From this beta test we were able to move through another iteration of the application and promptly moved back to development for the intended age group in order to complete a larger beta test in early 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The beta test that was completed in March 2016 included 38 students in 1st – 5th grade riding Bus 10. This beta test was a user-centered interaction test with a larger population specifically designed for the following reasons. We changed the plastic 3D printing device that holds the NFC tag and needed to discover: (1) were the devices designed appropriately for small hands, (2) could students use the device effectively, (3) would larger numbers of students scanning tags significantly delay or affect the bus schedule, and (4) to discover any additional challenges or obstacles that must be addressed.&lt;br /&gt;
During this third test, we encountered our first issue with the system. In the morning students scanned when entering the bus but their parents did not receive the text alert. However, the afternoon test worked well. Parents received the text alerts when students entered and exited the bus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From this test we learned that we need to build a failsafe system into the BusBudE application. We realize that before the phone was attached to the bus it was dropped down several stairs of the bus. The phone must have turned off but because of the way the case was designed there was no way to visually see that the phone was disconnected. The team is working on a re-design to address this issue. In addition, the team is working on a way to design the app so that students can scan without touching the device to make the scanning process faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Future of BusBudE&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Currently BusBudE is in its beta stages, thus there are many aspects that need to be altered and adapted before our product can truly be finished.  In terms of upgrading our system, we would like to integrate a clear light and sound indication for the students.  This would allow them to recognize if their tag scanned and if they are on the correct bus by using a green light and a sound notification for the correct bus and a red light with a sound alert if they are on the wrong bus.  We are also looking into the addition of an external display indicating the status of the scanned NFC tag as a solution to this problem.  Also, we are currently working to edit our code to enable more features such as precise GPS location notification and to further enhance the reach of the application.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The NFC tags we had purchased for previous beta tests weren&#039;t cost effective and were a temporary solution, thus we have started collaborating with an Australian based start-up to lower costs for mass orders and integrate our logo onto each tag.  We currently use a phone for our NFC scanner, yet in future iterations we would like to change it to a customized scanner specifically for BusBudE to include increased proximity and reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have already conducted several beta tests, yet with every revision to BusBudE we would like to hold at least one beta test to observe the effect of each specific change in our product. In the future we hope to include full functionality and use of the application serving every student within the South Fayette School District.  From this point, assuming the implementation is successful, we would like to begin to expand to other districts and potentially become an entrepreneurship venture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/busbude-team2.png&quot; style=&quot;width: 80%; display: block; margin: auto;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Altona Middle School Team Builds Diction Defender App</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/03</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/denver1.jpg&quot; align=&quot;right&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%; margin-left: 10px;&quot; /&gt;Last weekend, I had the pleasure of meeting the Altona Middle School team from Longmont, Colorado, who is one of the eight Best in Nation Verizon App Challenge winners. They were beginning their App Inventor training to learn the skills necessary to develop their app, Diction Defender, over the next few months. In the morning, MIT Master Trainer, Ann Root, took the students through the storyboarding process where the students designed the order and layout of the various app screens. The afternoon was spent working directly with App Inventor. Each student worked on a separate App Inventor tutorials, each with a different focus or feature. Then the students came together to share what they have learned with the group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/denver2.jpg&quot; align=&quot;left&quot; style=&quot;width: 30%; margin-right: 10px;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The app is intended to help students become better writers by leading them through a game that features a series of grammar questions with increasing degrees of difficulty. The game theme is a journey through different landscapes on an island, with pitfalls if the user answers incorrectly. Their mentor and computer science teacher, Mollie Kelleher, a former English teacher, is helping the team with the grammar side of things. The game is highly visual, so the artistic abilities of team members will be a big part of the user interface. There are some tricky technical algorithms for the students to work out, but they appear to be up for the challenge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The enthusiasm and energy was high as the students began what will be an intensive few months of development. In June, they will present their app at National TSA Conference in Nashville, Tennessee. It was a great experience to see this team in action and I look forward to seeing and playing Diction Defender in June. &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>App Inventor program in Germany receives 250.000 € from Google.org</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/02/app</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest blog post by Diana Knodel, AppCamps Germany&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/diana.png&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 15%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.appcamps.de&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;App Camps&lt;/a&gt; is a German non-profit that uses the MIT App Inventor to teach coding and app development in schools. Out of thousands of projects, the non-profit was selected as a finalist in the Google Impact Challenge Germany. App Camps receives 250.000 € (about 280.000 $) from Google.org to expand the program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a public voting an overall winner will be selected. The winner will receive another 250.000 €.  It would be awesome to get support from the App Inventor community. Please vote for us &lt;a href=&quot;https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/deutschland/charity/app_camps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you so much!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;How did it all start?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started App Camps as a side project back in 2013. The first workshop - an App Summer Camp for girls - was a huge success. After this event we got many requests from kids, parents, teachers and schools. Doing these workshops was great fun. But we reached to few students and thus decided to change our approach: We developed a platform and digital teaching materials for teachers in German language. That way they can teach coding without us being present in person. On the platform teachers get all materials including online training in order to do coding workshops in their classrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The course on App development&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are currently providing teaching material for seven App Inventor sessions. Teachers get access to short videos and learning cards that are printed out for the students. In each session, the students build their own apps. Over the course of seven sessions they learn the basics of coding and app development. In the end of the course each students has his or her own quiz app.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/teaching.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto; width: 100%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also use agile development methods in the course:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Daily Standup:&lt;/strong&gt; Sessions always start with a stand up. Students come together to watch a short video in which the app is presented and they see some live coding. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Pair Programming:&lt;/strong&gt; The students do pair programming and learn how to discuss code. They are guided by learning cards and can work in their own pace. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Review:&lt;/strong&gt; Near the end of the session all students meet again for a review and to discuss the app and learnings.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each session ends with a short video in which engineers explain the most important concepts of the session, for example variables, if-else, or methods. The engineers work for tech companies like Github, Adobe, Soundcloud or XING. With these videos, students have the chance to “meet” tech rolemodels and hear interesting things about Tech companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Course evaluation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this approach we were able to reach more than 1.500 students in only four months as compared to 500 students in two years. As a non-profit we want to make a social impact. Both students and teachers fill out questionnaires before and after the course. Here are first results:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/appcamps_results.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto; width: 75%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the course on App development students&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;want to continue to code&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;think coding is more fun&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;have a better understanding of the work of programmers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;can imagine choosing a career that involves coding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Teachers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;really like the App inventor and the materials we provide. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;say that it is very likely that they recommend the course to other teachers (9.5 on a scale from 1 to 10). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are highly interested in additional courses on programming.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What’s next?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our goal is to reach 15.000 students within the next two years and to grow the App Inventor community in German speaking countries. We will also develop additional courses on App development and other topics. The funding from the Google Impact Challenge helps us to continue what we do. It would be great if you support us and vote for us:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/deutschland/charity/app_camps&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://impactchallenge.withgoogle.com/deutschland/charity/app_camps&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Google App Inventor Competition in China a Huge Success</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/01-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest blog post by Kathy Deng, Google China&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/kathy_deng.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 15%;&quot; /&gt;We just wrapped up the 2015 App Inventor contest for high school and middle school students in China [&lt;a href=&quot;http://app.gzjkw.net/GAIC2015/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;contest website in Chinese&lt;/a&gt;], which rolled out in June. This is the 2nd year we ran this nationwide App Inventor contest. The goals were (1) to encourage high school students, middle school students, and upperclassmen at primary school to learn Computational Thinking, (2) to let students gain hands-on mobile application development experience through App Inventor and (3) to boost CS education among young students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the result of the collaboration between MIT, the Guangzhou Education Information Center and South China University of Technology, users in China can now access the local App Inventor server [&lt;a href=&quot;http://app.gzjkw.net/login/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the list of the highlights from this year’s contest:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diversity:&lt;/strong&gt; A team of two female students took home with the first prize in the middle school group. Out of the 20 student teams selected for the final onsite competition, five were female student teams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantity &amp;amp; quality:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of submissions this year is 1,095, more than doubling last year’s numbers. We were told by the MIT App Inventor team judge that there was significant improvement in the quality of submitted apps. And he added this is the direct result from the promotion of App Inventor in China for the past three years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More schools:&lt;/strong&gt; the contest got submissions from 258 schools which is an 80% increase compared to last year’s number. We found out more and more high and middle schools are interested in having opportunities for their students to learn CS in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/google_china_comp.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto; width: 60%;&quot; /&gt;On November 15, we held the onsite competition and awards ceremony at the Google Shanghai office. There were 10 high school teams, 10 middle school teams, parents and teachers in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited &lt;strong&gt;Prof. Hal Abelson from MIT&lt;/strong&gt; to give a welcome speech to more than 70 attendees via Google Hangout video conference at the beginning of the event. Hal mentioned that when he created App Inventor at Google and MIT, he hoped that talented students could use mobile computing to make apps which are both creative and beautiful. This year’s submissions reaffirmed his goal. He was so proud of the students and offered a warm congratulation to students, parents, and teachers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each finalist presented and demoed their applications to the judges, which included Google engineers and Weihua Li from the MIT App Inventor team. Below are the winning apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;●      First prize in high school group: Xushi (virtual robot assistant)&lt;br /&gt;
●      First prize in middle school group: Eyes Care (eye exam chart on app)&lt;br /&gt;
●      Other winning applications: Swap, iHouse, Fresh Food, Go to School, Run, BarCodeRegister, My Handbook, Fuxidashi (exam review master), XHTXQ (reminder), F1 Car Race, Calculator, Fighting, Foodline, Grader, Labyrinth, Life Assistant, SAT II Biology Helper, HalliGalli&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/chinese_comp_apps.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin:auto; width: 50%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This was great teamwork from Google, MIT App Inventor team, South China University of Technology (local partner), and Guangzhou Education Information Center (hosting local App Inventor server). All parties have contributed to this contest in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>US FIRST Robotics Uses App Inventor to Design Robot Controllers</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/01/us</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest post by Thomas Eng, US FIRST&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/thomas-eng.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 15%;&quot; /&gt;FIRST is a non-profit organization, founded by inventor Dean Kamen, with a mission to inspire young people to pursue careers in science and technology.  FIRST engages children with exciting, Mentor-based programs that build science, engineering, and technology skills, that inspire innovation, and that foster well rounded life capabilities including self-confidence, communication, and leadership.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The FIRST Tech Challenge group organizes robotics competitions for children in grades 7 through 12.  Teams build robots from a kit of parts.  Teams use these robots to compete in themed competitions around the world.  For 2015-2016 season, teams are building robots to compete in the official FIRST Res-Q game, which models its challenges after mountain rescue situations.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 50%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first1.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;This season’s game, FIRST Res-Q, models its tasks after mountain rescue situations&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Each team uses an Android Smartphone as the primary controller for their competition robot.  Teams can use a special branch of the MIT App Inventor to program their robot controllers and to create customized behaviors for their competition bots.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 50%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first2.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;Teams build robots that are controlled by Android smartphones&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Teams can use the MIT App Inventor to design their robot controller apps using special FTC-specific design components.  These FTC-specific design components allow the users to communicate with and control the hardware devices (motors, servos and sensors) that are installed on a robot.  The FTC-specific design blocks were implemented by an engineer from Google, Liz Looney, who was introduced to FIRST by Hal Abelson and his CSAIL team from MIT.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first3.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 60%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first4.png&quot; style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 60%;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because teams often do not have access to the Cloud at the competition venues for the FIRST Tech Challenge events, a solution was implemented that allows teams to run the MIT App Inventor locally, on their team laptops, using VirtualBox.  Teams design and build their robot controller apps with their local MIT App Inventor servers, and then the transfer and install them (typically using a USB cable) to their Android smartphones.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;figure style=&quot;display:block; margin: auto; width: 60%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/first5.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;figcaption style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;Teams use VirtualBox to run the MIT App Inventor application locally on the laptops&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The MIT App Inventor has been very well received by the FIRST community.  App Inventor’s user friendly, visual interface and the easy-to-understand Blockly programming language makes the programming tasks more accessible and manageable, especially for novice programmers.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&quot;display: block; margin: auto; width: 60%;&quot;&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;
“The MIT App Inventor has been a particularly huge hit in the under-served areas… The students were joyful that they now had been empowered to make the robot move by themselves.  Thank-you.”
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p style=&quot;text-align: right; margin-right: 15%;&quot;&gt;

 <title>Students Win App Competition in Hong Kong with App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2016/01</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest post by AU Hoi Kin, Head of Academic Department, Pak Kau College, Hong Kong&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/chineseappwinners.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 30%;&quot; hspace=&quot;”5”&quot; vspace=&quot;”1”&quot; /&gt;Chiu Wai Hang, Chan Pak Long and Ho Kai Yui from Pak Kau College in Hong Kong were recent winners of an app development competition &lt;a href=&quot;http://hkaast.org.hk/%E9%97%9C%E6%84%9B%E7%94%9F%E6%B4%BB&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Creative Invention - Mobile Apps&lt;/a&gt; held by The Hong Kong Association for the Advancement of Science and Technology. The students built an app to help people with intellectual disabilities who have trouble communicating with others and navigating when travelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The mobile application developed by the team contains two major functions. The first function helps persons with intellectual disabilities express a variety of emotions and ordinary conversation by using twelve simple and clear icons. The application provides pre-recorded soundtracks that play when users click selected icons. For example, users can click the police station icon to ask for help from passersby when they are lost.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The second major function is positioning. Supervisors can set a permissible area of travel for app users. The system will send an automatic message to the supervisor if the user is outside of the permissible travel area and will continuously report their position to the supervisor. This could be a useful function for elderly people too.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The theme of the app competition was assisting a socially vulnerable group. There were four target social groups, with two round eliminations resulting in a champion, first runner-up and second runner-up in each group.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The three team members, who are Secondary 4 students at Pak Kau College, admitted that there were many difficulties in creating their app. They needed to read many books and references and tried to “learn by doing”. One of the major difficulties they had was with the accuracy of the global positioning system (GPS). Although the positioning system was precise, there were some issues. For example, the positioning system can locate the users within a building but cannot determine which floor he/she is on. Therefore, their families cannot find them quickly using the app. To bolster the app’s functionality, the students added the communication feature. The users can take advantage of pre-recorded dialogue to communicate with others for help.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The team had another major difficulty a few days before the competition. After finishing the final version of the app, they inadvertently deleted all their code. Since the program runs in the cloud, changes were auto saved. Sadly, the efforts of two months came to naught. Nevertheless, the students encouraged each other and bounced back. In the final days before the competition, they rewrote the code of the crude older version and finished the program. They learned a lot in the competition, especially mobile app programming and English.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Since the competition, the students have continued to improve the app in appearance and function, such as using a simple smiling face to be the image representing happy. The students want to add the function of daily conversation in addition to the current ability to ask for directions. The students would like to invite interested parties to try the app and test the difficulty level of operation. Then, the students can modify the app and make it more suitable and friendly to users. Hopefully, it can change people’s lives.

 <title>Russian Language App Inventor Education Site Launched</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2015/12-1</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;This is a guest post by Boris Yarmakhov.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/BorisSquare.JPG&quot; style=&quot;float: left; margin-right: 2%; margin-bottom: 0.5em; width: 20%;&quot; hspace=&quot;”5”&quot; vspace=&quot;”1”&quot; /&gt;Mobile Apps Academy web site  - &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinvent.ru/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://appinvent.ru&lt;/a&gt; was launched in Russia in December, 2015. The site is intended for Russian speaking school teachers who plan to teach development of Android apps with MIT App Inventor. The site contains manuals, presentations, lesson plans, a curriculum and media files, which a teacher might use to start teaching MIT App Inventor in their classroom. The materials can also be used by independent learners. Two initial cohorts of Russian teachers have already been instructed using the website materials. Several webinars and teacher training events were held this year and often was heard the question “What is next?” from teachers. So the Mobile Apps Academy website just announced a contest for Russian middle and high school students for the best app developed with MIT App Inventor. The contest committee will select the best project, taking into consideration its idea, design and code. If enough submissions are received, junior and senior subdivisions will be created. The deadline for submissions is May, 2016. The winner will receive a Samsung tablet as a prize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;В декабре 2015 г.  в России был запущен веб сайт Академия мобильных приложений - &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinvent.ru/&quot;&gt;http://appinvent.ru/&lt;/a&gt; . Сайт предназначен для школьных учителей и всех тех, кто хотят научиться разработке мобильных приложений для Android с помощью MIT App Inventor. На сайте находятся рекомендации, презентации, разработки уроков, учебная программа, а также мультимедийные файлы, необходимые для того, чтобы начать преподавать основы MIT App Inventor в школе. Две первые группы российских учителей уже прошли обучение на основе материалов сайта. Кроме того, на сайте можно найти информацию о конкурсе для российских школьников на разработку лучшего мобильного приложения для Android, созданного с помощью MIT App Inventor. Конкурс продлится до 15 мая 2016 года. Его победителя ждет планшет от компании Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Mexican Students Win Top Spot in National Science Fair with App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2015/12-0</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two female Mexican students, Roxana Galilea and Reyna Guadalupe, won first place in a national science fair (Expo Ciencia Nacional 15) using App Inventor. Their prototype app, Digi Voz Sistem, can recognize voice commands and transmit them through Bluetooth to an Arduino microprocessor to open doors, turn lights on and off, and even start up a car. The two students agree that this project has positively changed their lives. Both are now considering careers in the science and technology fields. They are excited and proud to represent Mexico at the International event, CIENCAP, that will take place in Asuncion, Paraguay  in 2016.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is another wonderful example of the amazing things young people are creating with App Inventor. We wish Roxana and Reyna the best of luck in Paraguay.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

 <title>Superior Deca Squad Participates in FIRST Lego League</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/karen/2015/12</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/SDS.jpg&quot; style=&quot;float: right; margin-left: 2%; margin-bottom: 0.5em; &quot; hspace=&quot;”5”&quot; vspace=&quot;”1”&quot; /&gt;Last week I had the privilege of meeting, via Skype, the members of the Superior Deca Squad from Herndon, VA. They were preparing to present their project at the Virginia State Meet of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/fll&quot;&gt;FIRST (for the Inspiration and Recognition of Science &amp;amp; Technology) Lego League (FLL)&lt;/a&gt;.  These ten eager and innovative 5th graders from Oak Hill Elementary School in Herndon were very poised and enthusiastic as they explained to me their vision for Cam Can, a system of recycling bins that would scan, automatically sort, weight, drain, and compact recycled items. Their unique system would also reward users with game tokens and gift cards, to entice long term use, and increase recycling trash from 33% to 67% in their county.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another piece of their project was a prototype for an app made with App Inventor that would notify the user of nearby recycling bins so they could find a place to recycle. In addition, the app would allow the user to scan a QR code to earn credits for recycling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each member of the team spoke about their part in the project. Some worked on programming their robot, others the App Inventor app, while others focused on the presentation and marketing materials. All members of the team were involved in research on the topic of trash and recycling. The team visited their county waste management facility, a security data destruction company, and a hospital to see how each of those organization deal with trash. Close to home, they met with the head of their school cafeteria to talk trash. As a result of their meeting, the simple solution of relocation of the recycling bin in the cafeteria improved the percentage of recycling that took place at the school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They competed on December 5 at the Virginia State Meet at James Madison University, along with 108 other teams. Their research scores and performance were Exemplary, and they were in the top performers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of FLL, they also competed in:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;
Teamwork judging; learning that TEAM stands for teachable, energizer, achiever, &amp;amp; mission focused; and used gracious professionalism (respect and kindness to enhance team communication and relating to others).
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
Technical and Robot judging: They designed a robot and programmed mission runs, using EV3 programming, to run their robot through an obstacle course designed by FLL.
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;From my interaction with these students, I definitely saw their collaboration and teamwork. Each team member participated, was respectful of each other, and was excited about their project. It was a pleasure to see such enthusiasm for solving a real world problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The FIRST LEGO League &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge#block-block-19&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;TRASH TREK℠ Challenge&lt;/a&gt; involved more than 233,000 children ages 9 to 16 from over 80 countries to explore the fascinating world of trash and to design solutions for it. &lt;/p&gt;
