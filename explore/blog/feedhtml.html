I recently teamed up with CS teacher Kristin Violette to write an article for the July issue of &lt;em&gt;CSTA Voice&lt;/em&gt;. In the article we chronicle how Kristin&#039;s students at Newtown High School in Connecticut have used App Inventor to forge a personalized connection between CS and their local community. Kristin and I will be presenting at the CSTA Annual Conference in Quincy, MA on July 16th. We hope to see you there!  &lt;a href=&quot;http://csta.acm.org/Communications/sub/CSTAVoice_Files/csta_voice_07_2013.pdf&quot; style=&quot;width:300;height:100;&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>$200K Keck Grant for Appinventor.org</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/caitlin/2013/04/200k-keck-grant-appinventororg</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Wolber and the University of San Francisco received a $200,000 grant from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wmkeck.org/grant-programs/undergraduate-program/grant-abstracts/2012/1360-undergraduate-edu-grant-abstracts-university-of-san-francisco.html&quot;&gt;W.M. Keck Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to launch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://democratizecomputing.org/&quot;&gt;Democratize Computing Lab at USF&lt;/a&gt; .  The Lab’s mission is to break down the programmer divide and radically broaden and diversify the pool of software creators. The Lab will be using App inventor to allow beginners to build useful apps within days and experience the joy of computing and real-world problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolber has been involved with App Inventor since its inception at Google in 2009, and co-authored a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/App-Inventor-Create-Your-Android/dp/1449397484&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; with App Inventor creator Hal Abelson and two of the Google engineers on the App Inventor team (including Mills College professor Ellen Spertus). His site &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.org/&quot;&gt;appinventor.org&lt;/a&gt;, which provides video lessons and course materials for students and teachers, recently received its millionth hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lab is involved with a number of App Inventor education projects for providing beginners with an entry-way into the world of programming. Wolber and his students are completing and refining the “course-in-a-box” materials for students and teachers on the appinventor.org site. They’re also working with MIT and UMass-Lowell on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;App Inventor Community Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, a site where students, teachers, and developers share apps and learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolber will continue to direct the Lab in the fall while on Sabbatical at MIT, where he’ll be serving as a visiting faculty member and working with Hal Abelson and the App Inventor team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Computer Science Educators embrace App Inventor at SIGCSE</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2013/03/computer-science-educators-embrace-app-inventor-sigcse</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahh, Denver in March: Sunny and 60 on Thursday, blizzard on Saturday... but we had a blast!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy to report that the 44th annual meeting of the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education (SIGCSE) was a wonderful success, and that App Inventor was well represented by educators from all over the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sigcse.org/sigcse2013/&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;float:left; margin-right:5px; vertical-align:text-top;&quot; src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/sigcse2013_banner-400px.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Over 1100 attendees met for three days of sharing research, collaborating, catching up, and learning from one another. While this was only my second time attending this conference, I felt as if I was visiting my extended family. It&#039;s invigorating to be surrounded by so many people who are working toward the same goals and who care about the same issues: increasing access to quality computer science education for all people. This year&#039;s theme was &quot;The Changing Face of Computing&quot; and throughout the conference keynote speakers talked about issues surrounding diversity in computing. I was especially moved by the closing speech given by Jane Margolis. She told us about her days as a telephone repair technician (complete with a photo of her in a harness hanging from a pole!) and she connected that experience with what is happening today in technical fields. Women and minorities continue to be underrepresented in STEM, most egregiously in computing. Dr. Margolis issued a call for all of us to rise to the challenge of changing this paradigm, emphasizing the relationship of this work to a larger educational crisis and issues we face as world citizens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was gratifying to see the breadth of &lt;strong&gt;papers and workshops focused on App Inventor (listed below)&lt;/strong&gt; at this year&#039;s SIGCSE Conference. You can read the papers by clicking the titles which link directly to the PDFs on the conference website.&lt;/p&gt;

The CS Principles Project is an NSF-funded initiative to develop a breadth-first advanced placement (AP) course in computer science. App Inventor is a visual, blocks-based programming language that makes sophisticated computing concepts accessible to a broad range of students. This hands-on workshop, aimed at high school and undergraduate teachers, will introduce participants to lessons, homework exercises, project assignments, and assessment materials (quizzes, grading rubrics) that can be used in an App Inventor-based CS0 course. Participants will develop simple Android apps, using devices provided by the workshop, and will use them in the context of lessons and assignments that fit within the CS Principles framework. A laptop is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How to Plan and Run Computing Summer Camps for 4th-12th Grade Students&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Barbara  Ericson, Georgia Institute of Technology&lt;br /&gt;
Christopher  Michaud, Marist School&lt;br /&gt;
Nannette  Napier, Georgia Gwinnett College&lt;br /&gt;
Krishnendu  Roy, Valdosta State University&lt;br /&gt;
This workshop will provide details on how to run non-residential computing summer camps for 4th – 12th grade students. Georgia Tech has been offering camps since 2004. These camps are financially self- sustaining and effective. Items used include: Scratch, Alice, LEGO robots (WeDo, NXT, and Tetrix), and App Inventor. Georgia Tech has also helped start 11 other computing camps in Georgia. The workshop will include forms, a timeline, sample agendas, sample flyers, budget plans, a planning checklist, suggested projects, surveys, pre and post tests, evaluation results, and more. Intended audience: high school teachers and undergraduate faculty that are interested in creating computing summer camps for 4th – 12th grade students. Laptop recommended&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Meet the MIT App Inventor Training Corps</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/josh/2013/03/meet-mit-app-inventor-training-corps</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;align:center&quot;&gt;&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/MIT_AppInv_Training_Corps.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;MIT App Inventor Training Corps @ the MIT Media Lab&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Back Row, left to right: Arta Szathmary, Kelly Powers, Shaileen Pokress, Kristin Violette, Barbara Ericson; Front Row: Krishnendu Roy, Josh Sheldon, Mark Sherman, William Smith&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past Friday and Saturday, at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.media.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT Media Lab&lt;/a&gt;, I had the honor of welcoming seven educators and App Inventor experts from around the country to the inaugural working group meeting of the MIT App Inventor Training Corps. Joined by other representatives from the MIT App Inventor team and Phil Puthumana of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.verizonfoundation.org/ &quot;&gt;Verizon Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, we gathered to prepare to train the ten Best in Nation winning teams who competed in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://verizonfoundation.org/appchallenge/&quot;&gt;Verizon Innovative App Challenge&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These winning teams, &lt;a href=&quot;http://newscenter.verizon.com/corporate/news-articles/2013-03-18-innovative-app-challenge/&quot;&gt;announced on Monday afternoon&lt;/a&gt;, were selected through a rigorous judging process from a pool of more than 470 submitted concepts. Each winning team has been matched with an MIT App Inventor Training Corps member, who will provide online and in person support as the teams use App Inventor as a tool to refine and build the apps they proposed in their Challenge proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re very fortunate to have such experts as part of this initial group of trainers, and look forward to witnessing the work they do in concert with the winners of the Verizon Innovative App Challenge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&#039;re also fortunate to be working with an amazing team from the Verizon Foundation. We thank the Verizon Foundation for their generous gift to the Center for Mobile Learning at MIT that turned the Training Corps project from a dream into a reality!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>MIT CML at Mobile World Congress</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2013/03/mit-cml-mobile-world-congress</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leo Burd and I have recovered from jetlag and are ready to report on our trip to the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona February 25-28. We went to MWC to represent the MIT Center for Mobile Learning as part of the unX network, a partnership with CSEV, UNED, Telefónica, and Banco Santander that is creating the first learning and entrepreneurship portal for Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MWC conference was HUGE! Over 70,000 people attended from all over the world, and representing every branch of industry related to mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found our niche in the Spain Pavilion, where many people stopped to hear about unX and App Inventor. Leo Burd was part of a presentation about the success of unX, along with several other key players including Mr. Victor Calvo-Sotelo, the Spanish Secretary of State for Telecommunications, and Mr. Cesar Alierta, President of Telefónica Group. During the presentation, we officially announced that unX was now available in both Portuguese and Spanish for anyone to join in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/Leo_speaking.jpeg&quot; syle=&quot;float:left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the presentation was going on in the Spanish pavilion, I (Shaileen Pokress) was busy giving a talk to a packed room as part of the mEducation panel. There was overwhelming interest in the topic of mobile technology for education, as evidenced by the extremely long line outside the door (most were turned away due to lack of space.) I&#039;m certain that MWC will provide a larger space at next year&#039;s conference for this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/mwc_panel_sm.jpg&quot; syle=&quot;float:left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenters and panelists at the mEducation session were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graham Brown-Martin, Education Design Labs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peggy Johnson, Qualcomm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Held, Etisalat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florence Gaudry-Perkins, Alcatel-Lucent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanessa Lucio, Telefonica Learning Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaileen Pokress,MIT Center for Mobile Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We each had a different take on what &quot;mobile education&quot; means, and how mobile technologies can change the landscape of schooling. While most of the points made by my co-presenters had to do with educational content for mobile devices, I made sure to emphasize that the Center for Mobile Learning aims to provide ways for students to create their own mobile learning tools and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this post has gotten longer than I&#039;d intended. Up next... SIGCSE 2013. App Inventor was well represented, and our team made it home despite the snow storm! Stay tuned...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

CML staff Shay and Leo are currently in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress, presenting on unX. Created through a partnership between MIT, UNED, Santander, Telefónica and CSEV, unX is the first online learning portal (MOOC) specifically created to foster entrepreneurship in Ibero-American countries.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/all/files/NOTA%20DE%20PRENSA%20PRESENTACION%20unX_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;Learn More about unX and the Mobile World Conference in this downloadable press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we&#039;ll have to wait for a full report until they get back, in the meantime, they&#039;ve sent some exciting news: our partner CSEV recently received the New Media Consortium&#039;s Center of Excellence Award for their work on unX! This award, given for excellence in the application of technology to education and learning, recognizes CSEV&#039;s work in &quot;developing inventive and interactive models to transmit knowledge in online environments. &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/all/files/NMC%202013%20Center%20of%20Excellence%20Awards_Release.pdf&quot;&gt;Read More about unX NMC Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know Shay and Leo will return from Barcelona with great stories and insights from their unX colleagues, and from the multitude of exciting technology enthusiasts at the Mobile World Congress. We look forward to sharing them with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

If you have been running Java 7 you may get a notice when opening the Blocks Editor that asks you to update Java. You must run this update to use App Inventor. This issue is due to a vulnerability in Java that affects all users -- not just App Inventor users and not even just Mac users. We will continue to monitor the situation and let you know what else, if anything, you&#039;ll need to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with today’s release of MIT App Inventor, v132, you no longer need a USB cable to connect your phone to your computer.  We have added the option to connect the phone to the computer wirelessly.  Not only does this avoid the cable, it also eliminates the often tedious process (on Windows) of finding, downloading, and installing drivers specific to your device.  Now all you need now is a wireless (WiFi) network that your phone or device and your computer can both access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to use App Inventor wirelessly is to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion2&quot;&gt;MIT AICompanion&lt;/a&gt; from the Google Play Store. You start this App like any other Android App. The Blocks Editor now has a new “WiFI” choice in the “Connect to Device” menu. When you select that you will receive a six letter code which you enter into the MIT AICompanion to connect the phone to the PC. You are also shown a QR Code which you can use If your phone has a camera and a Bar Code Scanning Application. You can find more information and detailed documentation in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/setup-device-wifi&quot;&gt;wireless setup instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USB option is still there, same as before.  But we expect that most App Inventor users will use the wireless method, which in general will be easier to set up and will give better performance. There may be some situations where wireless won’t work well -- such as when there’s no local wireless network, or the wireless network has poor performance. But we recommend that everyone start out by trying wireless to see if it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we are enthusiastic about this new feature, and we hope this makes your App Inventor experience easier and more productive. Please give us your feedback on the forums and report any problems or issues you may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H*app*y Inventing&lt;br /&gt;
The MIT App Inventor Team&lt;/p&gt;
