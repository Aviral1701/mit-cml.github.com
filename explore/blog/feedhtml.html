 <title> Shay Pokress to join Project Lead the Way</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2014/04/shay</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#039;m writing with bittersweet emotion to announce that Shaileen (Shay) Pokress, our MIT App Inventor Director of Education, will be leaving MIT at the beginning of May to take up a position as Director of Computer Science Instruction for Project Lead The Way. Project Lead the Way is one of the country&#039;s top providers of STEM educational programs, with curriculum used in more than 5000 schools. Shay will initially focus on computing curriculum for middle school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shay has been the face of MIT App Inventor to the K-12 educational community from almost the day the project moved from Google to MIT. Those of you working with App Inventor in schools and teacher communities know what a terrific force Shay&#039;s been in emphasizing the potential for kids to be creators of mobile technology. Most recently, she led the re-purposing in December of MIT&#039;s App Inventor curriculum for the launch of App Inventor 2 and the subsequent outreach over the past four months, a period during which one and a half million new apps were started using App Inventor, and the number of regular weekly users of our MIT site grew from 60,000 to 85,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shay&#039;s achievements at MIT App Inventor will a hard act to follow:  we&#039;ll miss her insight, her energy, and her enthusiasm. At the same time, we&#039;re happy that she&#039;s moving into a position where she can have such larger impact on emerging K-12 school computer science education, and we&#039;re looking forward to her carrying the values of App Inventor and the Center for Mobile Learning to a new, larger sphere of influence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;== Hal&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>One Computer At a Time</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/jeff/2014/03/one</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;MIT App Inventor is designed to be used by an individual using only&lt;br /&gt;
one computer at a time. If you open a project on one computer and then&lt;br /&gt;
open the same project on a second computer (or even in a second&lt;br /&gt;
browser window) you can cause your project to become corrupted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is because the two sessions do not know about each other. So the&lt;br /&gt;
last session to save the blocks “wins.” For example if you open a&lt;br /&gt;
project on a computer in your office and then go home and open the&lt;br /&gt;
same project from your home computer and make some changes. When you&lt;br /&gt;
return to your office, your office computer will not have the changes&lt;br /&gt;
you made at home. If you modify any blocks on your office computer,&lt;br /&gt;
the version in your office computer will be saved. Your changes from&lt;br /&gt;
your home computer will be lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Sunday March 16th we will be installing a new version of MIT App&lt;br /&gt;
Inventor. This version will introduce a new feature. When you login to&lt;br /&gt;
App Inventor, any previous session will become “read only.” A red&lt;br /&gt;
warning bar will appear on them warning you that changes on that&lt;br /&gt;
computer will not be saved. Simple rule, most recent login is OK,&lt;br /&gt;
others will not be able to save changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately we cannot introduce this change seamlessly. When we&lt;br /&gt;
perform the actual upgrade, anyone using MIT App Inventor will receive&lt;br /&gt;
a red-bar error indicating that we have done an update. You will then&lt;br /&gt;
just need to reload your browser’s window in order to continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Time to Update the Companion</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/jeff/2014/02/time</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the beginning of January &lt;a href=&quot;/blogs/jeff/2014/01/new-version-setup-tools&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;I wrote&lt;/a&gt; to explain how we are going to reduce the number of times you have to update your MIT App Inventor software installation by distributing a Companion App with the ability to update itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On February 11 we’ll implement this auto-update mechanism in MIT App Inventor 2, so that your Companion App will be brought up to the newest version.  To take advantage of this new feature, you might have to manually update Companion one final time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!--break--&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you have completed this one-time update to install the newest version of the companion, future updates will happen automatically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you need to do&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running the latest version already (2.15ai2zx1) then no action is required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running version older than 2.10ai2 (and 2.10ai2zx1) you will be prompted that your Companion is out of date and you will have to manually update it by installing the new version using the instructions on the &lt;a href=&quot;/ai2/setup-device-wifi&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;WiFi Setup Page.&lt;/a&gt;  You probably already have been receiving warnings if you are running a Companion that old.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running a version between 2.10ai2 and 2.12.ai2, and you did not download it from the Google Play store, then you will see a dialog on your browser when you attempt to connect to the Companion from App Inventor. This dialog will explain that the auto-update is about to happen. Click “OK” and the update will commence. Once you do this, on your device (or in the emulator) you will see the Android Package Manager start (it may take a few seconds). It will tell you that there is an update for the Companion and ask for your permission to install it. Depending on the version of Android you have, you may be asked a second time for confirmation. In both cases, grant the permission and the Companion will update itself. When it is done, you will be returned to your device’s home screen. You will then need to restart the companion, at which point you should see the new version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are running in the Emulator, you should be able to select “Connect Emulator” again from the App Inventor Connect menu and you should get connected without issue. If you have difficulty, select “Reset Connections” from the “Connect” menu and try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

 <title>Hungry Middle Schoolers Create Prize-Winning Allergy App</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2014/02/hungry</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC News&lt;br /&gt;
Betsy Klein - December 12, 2013&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When 13-year-old Samantha Hinton is unsure of the ingredients in a snack, she just doesn’t eat it.&lt;br /&gt;
That’s because Samantha is among the growing population of food allergy sufferers in the United States, and she fears a bite containing peanuts could kill her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“I know it’s deadly,” she told ABC News. “And the side effects are just too scary.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But a team of eighth-graders at her New Hampshire school created a smartphone app that could make navigating the cafeteria a whole lot easier. The Hampstead Academy students took home the grand prize at Verizon’s App Challenge with their idea for “Chow Checker,” an app that identifies food allergens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blogs/hampstead_academy_team.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right;&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They submitted the video pitch last school year and got to work with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab to turn it into a reality. It is now available for download in Google Play.&lt;br /&gt;
“We knew that allergies were a pretty big problem,” ninth-grade team member Alex Mielens said. “We thought we could help solve that problem in our school and other places and help people who have allergies to stop from buying foods that may contain allergens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Food allergies affect an estimated 4 to 6 percent of children in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Food allergy prevalence has also increased 18 percent between 1997 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Time to Install New Setup Tools!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/jeff/2014/01/new-version-setup-tools</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Version 2.2 of the Mac and Windows Setup tools is yet another version!  Why so many versions? And what we are doing about it?!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MIT AI2 Companion is a copy of every “component” of App Inventor. When you are using the companion, your blocks program is sent over to the companion which then interprets the blocks in order to run your program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we update the App Inventor components, we need to distribute a new Companion which contains the updated components. Otherwise your program, when run on the Companion, may not work as expected. When you use a device (phone or tablet) and install the MIT AI2 Companion from the Google Play Store, you should select the “automatic update” option. This will cause the Play Store to send you a new version when we make one available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Android Emulator, which we distribute with the Setup Tools has a copy of the MIT AI2 Companion embedded in it. Because it wasn’t loaded from the Play Store, it doesn’t get updated. So when we distribute a new Companion, we need to distribute a new version of the Setup Tools. However we know that the Setup Tools package is large and can take some time to download and install. Particularly if you need to install it on several computers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately we believe that version 2.2 will be the last update for a while (fingers crossed). With version 2.2 we are introducing a self updating version of the Companion. If we update the components and build a new Companion, the next time you use the Emulator we will update the embedded Companion. You will receive a notification and will need to approve the installation in the Emulator. The Companion itself is a very small download, so should take a lot less time to install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you directly download the Companion on your device from our website instead of the Play Store&lt;/strong&gt;, then you will also receive the self updating Companion. When a new version is available, you will be prompted and a new version will be downloaded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you downloaded the Companion from the Play Store&lt;/strong&gt;, you will need to update your Companion from the Store. We cannot auto-update a Companion that was downloaded from the Google Play Store. So &lt;strong&gt;be sure to select the “automatic update” option&lt;/strong&gt; so the Store will automatically update your copy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;section class=&quot;field field-name-field-genre field-type-list-text field-label-above view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Genre:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;Blog&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/section&gt;</description>

The results were so strong that we decided to award two first-place prizes.  The winners are Arjun Santhoshkumar and Taifun Bär.  Arjun and Taifun worked hard to ferret out bugs, and they each identified several that were important to the MIT team in our launch of App Inventor 2.  Each of them will be receiving a Nexus 5 Android Smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re tremendously pleased with the results of the bugs contest.  This is a tribute to the care and enthusiasm of the App Inventor  community as we migrate from App Inventor Classic to App Inventor 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to Arjun and Taifun, there are 10 second-place winners and 7 third-place winners.   Each second-place winner will received .... and each third-place winner will receive ....&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to all the winners, and thanks to everyone who participated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;for the MIT App Inventor Team,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hal Abelson&lt;/p&gt;

Thanks you for your support for App Inventor and for your participation on these forums.  We at MIT have closed out a great year:  We met our major goal of launching App Inventor 2 before the end of 2013, and we&amp;#039;re eagerly watching usage grow.  More than 100,000 people have signed on to App Inventor 2 since we launched it at the beginning of December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Inventor Classic is no slouch either, which more than a million users.  We&amp;#039;ll be keeping Classic running through the school year in the spring, to accommodate classes that are using it this year.   We expect that people who are now starting out with App Inventor will start with AI2, and that people using Classic will migrate to AI2 over the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this key milestone passed, we&amp;#039;re looking forward to an even greater 2014, with more curriculum, more classes, more apps competitions, and more enthusiastic people like you who are experiencing the fun and fulfillment of creating your own mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#039;s to doing that together,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the MIT App Inventor Team,&lt;br /&gt;
