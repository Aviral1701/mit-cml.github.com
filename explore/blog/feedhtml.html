 <title>MIT CML at Mobile World Congress</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2013/03/mit-cml-mobile-world-congress</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leo Burd and I have recovered from jetlag and are ready to report on our trip to the GSMA Mobile World Congress in Barcelona February 25-28. We went to MWC to represent the MIT Center for Mobile Learning as part of the unX network, a partnership with CSEV, UNED, Telefónica, and Banco Santander that is creating the first learning and entrepreneurship portal for Latin America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MWC conference was HUGE! Over 70,000 people attended from all over the world, and representing every branch of industry related to mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We found our niche in the Spain Pavilion, where many people stopped to hear about unX and App Inventor. Leo Burd was part of a presentation about the success of unX, along with several other key players including Mr. Victor Calvo-Sotelo, the Spanish Secretary of State for Telecommunications, and Mr. Cesar Alierta, President of Telefónica Group. During the presentation, we officially announced that unX was now available in both Portuguese and Spanish for anyone to join in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/Leo_speaking.jpeg&quot; syle=&quot;float:left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the presentation was going on in the Spanish pavilion, I (Shaileen Pokress) was busy giving a talk to a packed room as part of the mEducation panel. There was overwhelming interest in the topic of mobile technology for education, as evidenced by the extremely long line outside the door (most were turned away due to lack of space.) I&#039;m certain that MWC will provide a larger space at next year&#039;s conference for this topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/mwc_panel_sm.jpg&quot; syle=&quot;float:left&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The presenters and panelists at the mEducation session were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Graham Brown-Martin, Education Design Labs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peggy Johnson, Qualcomm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;George Held, Etisalat&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Florence Gaudry-Perkins, Alcatel-Lucent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vanessa Lucio, Telefonica Learning Services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shaileen Pokress,MIT Center for Mobile Learning&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We each had a different take on what &quot;mobile education&quot; means, and how mobile technologies can change the landscape of schooling. While most of the points made by my co-presenters had to do with educational content for mobile devices, I made sure to emphasize that the Center for Mobile Learning aims to provide ways for students to create their own mobile learning tools and experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, this post has gotten longer than I&#039;d intended. Up next... SIGCSE 2013. App Inventor was well represented, and our team made it home despite the snow storm! Stay tuned...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Preliminary Report from World Mobile Congress</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/caitlin/2013/02/preliminary-report-world-mobile-congress</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s a busy time here for the App Inventor crew!  CML staff Shay and Leo are currently in Barcelona at Mobile World Congress, presenting on unX. Created through a partnership between MIT, UNED, Santander, Telefónica and CSEV, unX is the first online learning portal (MOOC) specifically created to foster entrepreneurship in Ibero-American countries.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/all/files/NOTA%20DE%20PRENSA%20PRESENTACION%20unX_EN.pdf&quot;&gt;Learn More about unX and the Mobile World Conference in this downloadable press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Though we&#039;ll have to wait for a full report until they get back, in the meantime, they&#039;ve sent some exciting news: our partner CSEV recently received the New Media Consortium&#039;s Center of Excellence Award for their work on unX! This award, given for excellence in the application of technology to education and learning, recognizes CSEV&#039;s work in &quot;developing inventive and interactive models to transmit knowledge in online environments. &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/all/files/NMC%202013%20Center%20of%20Excellence%20Awards_Release.pdf&quot;&gt;Read More about unX NMC Award&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know Shay and Leo will return from Barcelona with great stories and insights from their unX colleagues, and from the multitude of exciting technology enthusiasts at the Mobile World Congress. We look forward to sharing them with you soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Import Information about Java and App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/jeff/2013/02/import-information-about-java-and-app-inventor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you are running Java 6 on a Macintosh, you should run Apple&#039;s latest software update 12 released February 1st. If you have been running Java 7 you may get a notice when opening the Blocks Editor that asks you to update Java. You must run this update to use App Inventor. This issue is due to a vulnerability in Java that affects all users -- not just App Inventor users and not even just Mac users. We will continue to monitor the situation and let you know what else, if anything, you&#039;ll need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>App Inventor Goes Wireless!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/andrew/2012/12/app-inventor-goes-wireless</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are very excited to be able to announce that...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with today’s release of MIT App Inventor, v132, you no longer need a USB cable to connect your phone to your computer.  We have added the option to connect the phone to the computer wirelessly.  Not only does this avoid the cable, it also eliminates the often tedious process (on Windows) of finding, downloading, and installing drivers specific to your device.  Now all you need now is a wireless (WiFi) network that your phone or device and your computer can both access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step to use App Inventor wirelessly is to download the &lt;a href=&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=edu.mit.appinventor.aicompanion2&quot;&gt;MIT AICompanion&lt;/a&gt; from the Google Play Store. You start this App like any other Android App. The Blocks Editor now has a new “WiFI” choice in the “Connect to Device” menu. When you select that you will receive a six letter code which you enter into the MIT AICompanion to connect the phone to the PC. You are also shown a QR Code which you can use If your phone has a camera and a Bar Code Scanning Application. You can find more information and detailed documentation in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/setup-device-wifi&quot;&gt;wireless setup instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The USB option is still there, same as before.  But we expect that most App Inventor users will use the wireless method, which in general will be easier to set up and will give better performance. There may be some situations where wireless won’t work well -- such as when there’s no local wireless network, or the wireless network has poor performance. But we recommend that everyone start out by trying wireless to see if it works for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, we are enthusiastic about this new feature, and we hope this makes your App Inventor experience easier and more productive. Please give us your feedback on the forums and report any problems or issues you may encounter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H*app*y Inventing&lt;br /&gt;
The MIT App Inventor Team&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>NEW RELEASE brings sprite flinging, wifi texting, and more!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2012/11/new-release-brings-sprite-flinging-wifi-texting-and-more</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We have great news: the new release of App Inventor is now live, and contains some exciting new functionality. Be sure to read the &lt;a href=&quot;//beta.appinventor.mit.edu/ReleaseNotes.html&quot;&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; for the entire list of updates. Here are the highlights:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sprites and Canvas can now respond to &lt;b&gt;Fling, TouchDown, and TouchUp gestures&lt;/b&gt;. This offers a lot of potential for new games and interactive apps! Try out the &lt;a href=&quot;//appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/minigolf.html&quot;&gt;Mini Golf tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that shows you how to build a fun app that takes advantage of these new gesture events. The tutorial also offers a nice example for setting up screen components dynamically so that they look great on any size screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Support for &lt;b&gt;Google Fusion Tables&lt;/b&gt; has been updated. You can now build apps that read and write to a Google Fusion Table, providing a powerful data sharing solution. See the new &lt;a href=&quot;//appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/pizzaparty.html&quot;&gt;Pizza Party tutorial for a how-to guide on creating fusion tables&lt;/a&gt; and connecting to them through App Inventor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Texting is now enabled over wifi&lt;/b&gt; for phones without cell service (no SIM card)! While the traditional SMS texting over a cell phone provider still works just fine, this new capability allows you to connect to your &lt;b&gt;Google Voice account&lt;/b&gt; so that texts can be sent and received on devices that are only connected through wifi. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/google-voice&quot;&gt;How To Guide to Wifi Texting with App Inventor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The packaging process now uses the &lt;b&gt;zipalign&lt;/b&gt; tool so that applications can be placed in the Play store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is now a &lt;b&gt;Progress Bar&lt;/b&gt; that displays while you are building your app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;See other updates, fixes, and notes in the &lt;a href=&quot;//beta.appinventor.mit.edu/ReleaseNotes.html&quot;&gt;v130 Release Notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, check out the &lt;a href=&quot;https://bit.ly/AppInventorContest&quot;&gt;App Contest&lt;/a&gt;, taking place now in the &lt;a href=&quot;//gallery.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;App Inventor Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy Inventing! ~Shay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>App Inventor Community Gallery from UMass-Lowell &amp; USF Seeks More Beta Testers </title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/andrew/2012/10/app-inventor-community-gallery-umass-lowell-usf-seeks-more-beta-testers</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends and co-developers of the App Inventor Community Gallery have been hard at work and are seeking more &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/app-inventor-instructors/SO7Lbu-eOXs&quot;&gt;beta testers&lt;/a&gt; to load test, test the usability, and as importantly, to populate the Gallery with a range of interesting apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor Community Gallery is a site for sharing the code for apps you create, finding and learning from the apps built by others, and in general collaborating with other App Inventor developers. It is like Google Play, but all open source and all App Inventor apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gallery is currently in beta-release. It is being developed as a collaborative project involving UMass-Lowell, the University of San Francisco, and MIT. Its initial development was led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm/&quot;&gt;Fred Martin&lt;/a&gt; and Derrell Lipman of UMass-Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USF, led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://rock.usfca.edu/cs/wolber/&quot;&gt;David Wolber&lt;/a&gt;  and Vincent Zhang, is now leading the development in collaboration with Martin, Lipman and Paul Geromini of UMass-Lowell. The team is improving the site and gradually scaling it up for use by the thousands of App Inventor users, students, and educators. The goal is to open the site publicly by the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>New Release: Screen arrangements, resizable video, and more</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/2012/09/new-release-screen-arrangements-resizable-video-and-more</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing the newest App Inventor release!&lt;br /&gt;
Version 129 is now live. In addition to a few bug fixes and minor User Interface improvements, here are the exciting new features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resize-able and Full Screen Video support&lt;/strong&gt;. You can now resize an existing Video Player component from the blocks editor. In Android 2.0+ you can set a Video Player to use the entire phone&#039;s screen. The &lt;back&gt; key will restore it to its original size. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/videowall.html&quot;&gt;VideoWall tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start to check this out!&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal and Vertical Arrangements can now align their contents&lt;/strong&gt;. Arrangements and Screens can now align their contents along Left, Right, Center, Top and Bottom edges.&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: These settings have no effect if the arrangement size is set to automatic. The vertical setting has no effect if the screen is scrollable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canvas and Sprite Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;. The new events &quot;Flung&quot;, &quot;TouchUP&quot; and &quot;TouchDown&quot; have been added to Sprites and Canvases.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flung:&lt;/strong&gt; When a user touches a Sprite and then quickly swipes their finger in some direction, a &quot;Flung&quot; event is issued for the Sprite which gives the direction and speed of the swipe. This can be used to determine the direction and relative speed to move a Sprite. Canvases also receive a Flung event so a user can perform the swiping (Fling) motion anywhere on a Canvas and the MIT App Inventor programmer can decide how to handle it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TouchDown/TouchUp:&lt;/strong&gt; When a user places their finger on a Sprite, a TouchDown event is now triggered. When they lift their finger a TouchUP event is triggered. These events are in addition to the existing &quot;Touched&quot; event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New screen orientation settings:&lt;/strong&gt; (1) User (let&#039;s the app&#039;s user select portrait or landscape; and (2) Sensor (auto-rotates as the phone rotates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tutorials corresponding to these new features are coming soon so stay tuned. H*app*y Inventing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Ed Week features App Inventor as tool for engaging students</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/ed-week-features-app-inventor-tool-engaging-students</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check it out: Ed Week ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&quot;&gt;feature article on App Inventor&lt;/a&gt; and the power of teaching students how to build mobile apps. Many excellent programs are described in the article, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthapplab.com/&quot;&gt;Youth APPLab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iridescentlearning.org/programs/technovation-challenge/&quot;&gt;Technovation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthradio.org/&quot;&gt;Youth Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and others. My favorite quote is from an eighth grade girl: &quot;These programs expand your view on careers like computer science and engineering and show the fun in them.&quot; This is what we are all about at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning!&lt;br /&gt;
