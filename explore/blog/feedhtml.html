 <title>App Inventor Community Gallery from UMass-Lowell &amp; USF Seeks More Beta Testers </title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/andrew/2012/10/app-inventor-community-gallery-umass-lowell-usf-seeks-more-beta-testers</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our friends and co-developers of the App Inventor Community Gallery have been hard at work and are seeking more &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/app-inventor-instructors/SO7Lbu-eOXs&quot;&gt;beta testers&lt;/a&gt; to load test, test the usability, and as importantly, to populate the Gallery with a range of interesting apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor Community Gallery is a site for sharing the code for apps you create, finding and learning from the apps built by others, and in general collaborating with other App Inventor developers. It is like Google Play, but all open source and all App Inventor apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Gallery is currently in beta-release. It is being developed as a collaborative project involving UMass-Lowell, the University of San Francisco, and MIT. Its initial development was led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm/&quot;&gt;Fred Martin&lt;/a&gt; and Derrell Lipman of UMass-Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USF, led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://rock.usfca.edu/cs/wolber/&quot;&gt;David Wolber&lt;/a&gt;  and Vincent Zhang, is now leading the development in collaboration with Martin, Lipman and Paul Geromini of UMass-Lowell. The team is improving the site and gradually scaling it up for use by the thousands of App Inventor users, students, and educators. The goal is to open the site publicly by the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>New Release brings exciting new functionality!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/shay/%5Byyyy%5D/%5Bmon%5D/new-release-brings-exciting-new-functionality</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Announcing the newest App Inventor release!&lt;br /&gt;
Version 129 is now live. In addition to a few bug fixes and minor User Interface improvements, here are the exciting new features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resize-able and Full Screen Video support&lt;/strong&gt;. You can now resize an existing Video Player component from the blocks editor. In Android 2.0+ you can set a Video Player to use the entire phone&#039;s screen. The &lt;back&gt; key will restore it to its original size. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/content/videowall.html&quot;&gt;VideoWall tutorial&lt;/a&gt; is a good place to start to check this out!&lt;/back&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Horizontal and Vertical Arrangements can now align their contents&lt;/strong&gt;. Arrangements and Screens can now align their contents along Left, Right, Center, Top and Bottom edges.&lt;br /&gt;
NOTE: These settings have no effect if the arrangement size is set to automatic. The vertical setting has no effect if the screen is scrollable.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Canvas and Sprite Improvements&lt;/strong&gt;. The new events &quot;Flung&quot;, &quot;TouchUP&quot; and &quot;TouchDown&quot; have been added to Sprites and Canvases.
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flung:&lt;/strong&gt; When a user touches a Sprite and then quickly swipes their finger in some direction, a &quot;Flung&quot; event is issued for the Sprite which gives the direction and speed of the swipe. This can be used to determine the direction and relative speed to move a Sprite. Canvases also receive a Flung event so a user can perform the swiping (Fling) motion anywhere on a Canvas and the MIT App Inventor programmer can decide how to handle it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TouchDown/TouchUp:&lt;/strong&gt; When a user places their finger on a Sprite, a TouchDown event is now triggered. When they lift their finger a TouchUP event is triggered. These events are in addition to the existing &quot;Touched&quot; event.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New screen orientation settings:&lt;/strong&gt; (1) User (let&#039;s the app&#039;s user select portrait or landscape; and (2) Sensor (auto-rotates as the phone rotates)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tutorials corresponding to these new features are coming soon so stay tuned. H*app*y Inventing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Ed Week features App Inventor as tool for engaging students</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/ed-week-features-app-inventor-tool-engaging-students</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check it out: Ed Week ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&quot;&gt;feature article on App Inventor&lt;/a&gt; and the power of teaching students how to build mobile apps. Many excellent programs are described in the article, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthapplab.com/&quot;&gt;Youth APPLab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iridescentlearning.org/programs/technovation-challenge/&quot;&gt;Technovation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthradio.org/&quot;&gt;Youth Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and others. My favorite quote is from an eighth grade girl: &quot;These programs expand your view on careers like computer science and engineering and show the fun in them.&quot; This is what we are all about at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning!&lt;br /&gt;
Read the article here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&quot;&gt;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Welcome to the new App Inventor website!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/welcome-new-app-inventor-website</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello again,&lt;br /&gt;
After a bit of a hiatus, this blog is back in action. I was waiting to post a new entry until we had successfully rolled out the NEW WEBSITE! Now that it&#039;s here, I&#039;d like to draw your attention to a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor website hosted at MIT (appinventor.mit.edu) is actually three separate sites: the &quot;explore&quot; site, the &quot;teach&quot; site, and the &quot;service&quot; site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C95828&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;service site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the site you already know and love as it hosts the actual App Inventor software where you build your own app projects. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#9AAE47&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;explore site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is geared toward the casual visitor as well as the veteran app builder. We will post news, project updates, stories about people using App Inventor, and things of that nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://teach.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#73B3DF&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;teach site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or educators&#039; site, is an oasis of information and support for people who are using App Inventor with students -- of any age and in any setting. This is the area where I will be focusing much of my energy over the next several months, as we build this site to include more education materials, and as we build the community by engaging people in joining in the exchange of ideas around App Inventor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is valued and welcome! Please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; your thoughts and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&#039;d like to let you know about the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Invitational&lt;/em&gt; App Inventor Summit on July 13/14 in Cambridge, MA. This meeting is intended to set the agenda for the App Inventor project for the next year. For more information, and to see how you can apply to participate, see the &lt;a href=&quot;../summit&quot;&gt;Summit Information page&lt;/a&gt;. Applications close June 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s all for now. Happy inventing...&lt;br /&gt;
Shay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>App Inventor helping to bridge gap in numbers of CS Majors</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/app-inventor-helping-bridge-gap-numbers-cs-majors</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Inventors,  One of our main goals at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning is to encourage greater participation in computing from a wider and more varied assortment of people. App Inventor does this by inherently fostering personal creativity with technology. I was pleased to see App Inventor mentioned in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&quot;&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Maggie Johnson, Google&#039;s Director of Education, in which she writes about the resurgence of CS Education: &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&quot;&gt;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&lt;/a&gt;  little by little...&lt;br /&gt;
Shay&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Please help up test the new site for sharing App Inventor projects</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/please-help-test-new-site-sharing-app-inventor-projects</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since App Inventor was launched, there have been many requests  for a site where people can exhibit and share their App Inventor  work.   MIT and  University of Massachusetts at  Lowell are collaborating on creating such a Gallery site, which  we hope to launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, we are looking for volunteer testers to provide  feedback on the site and to help shake it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the App Inventor service was released from MIT, and before that  from Google, our testers were essential in getting the system  launched.   And the same will be true for this Gallery.   So we&#039;re  forward to your active -- and critically important -- participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For details, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/appinventor/2t7v0svkCq0&quot;&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; by Prof. Martin of UMass Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can  sign up to be a tester by completing the form at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/aig-beta-request&quot;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/aig-beta-request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hog Wild for App Inventor!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/hog-wild-app-inventor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello App Inventors, Things are moving right along here at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning. The community continues to grow and we have now topped the 90,000 mark for the number unique accounts on the App Inventor service! We have several initiatives underway to bring you new materials and learning opportunities. Stay tuned to this blog and to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum/index.html&quot;&gt;Educators&#039; forum&lt;/a&gt; for updates.  Today I&#039;d like to share an entertaining story... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;A science lab doesn&#039;t need to have a ceiling... a science lab doesn&#039;t even need to have walls!&quot;...&lt;/em&gt; Gina Hall McCarley, an Alabama high school teacher, shared a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories/wild-hogs-app&quot;&gt;story highlighting the usefulness of App Inventor as a tool for science exploration&lt;/a&gt;: tracking wildlife in a local forest. Using App Inventor, students programmed a simple data collection tool for documenting wild hog populations, to help scientists better understand a local environmental issue that has real-world implications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories?page=1&quot;&gt;Read more on the App Inventor stories pages&lt;/a&gt;, share these stories with other educators, and become inspired to help students create their own mobile tools for deepening learning across the curriculum.  Do you have a story to share? &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/contact&quot;&gt;Send it to us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

My name is Shaileen Pokress (“Shay”). I have just gotten started in my new position as Education Community Manager at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning. I am working with the App Inventor Team to facilitate sharing of ideas and materials in support of using App Inventor for learning. Whether you’re involved in informal settings or are using App Inventor in the classroom, I invite you to join with us as we build this community of educators.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/developers-blogs/hal/2012/mar/announcing-mit-app-inventor-open-beta-preview&quot;&gt;App Inventor was re-launched by MIT&lt;/a&gt; just two weeks ago, and already over 70,000 unique users have registered! We anticipate a great deal of activity over the coming months as this community begins to take advantage of this powerful tool for engaging learners in tinkering with technology.  That’s all for now. Sign up for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum/index.html&quot;&gt;App Inventor Educators’ Google Group&lt;/a&gt; to join our ongoing discussion.  -- Shay Pokress&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Announcing:  MIT App Inventor  Open Beta Preview</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/announcing-mit-app-inventor-open-beta-preview</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT Center for Mobile Learning is delighted to announce that we’re meeting our goal of making MIT App Inventor available as a public service in the first quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past two months, we have been conducting a closed test of the system for an increasing number of testers, and we’ve currently scaled to 5000 testers.   Today, we’re taking the next step, and opening the MIT App Inventor service to everyone.   All you will need is a Google ID for log-in (for example, a Gmail account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Inventor will now be suitable for any use, including running classes. But please be aware that this is the first time the system will be under load from a large number of users, so there may be bumps and adjustments as the load increases.   For now, we suggest that you maintain backup copies of important apps, as we see how things go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are glitches and minor errors and lots of room for improvement.  We’ll be turning our attention to these improvements, once we have more experience with running the system at scale. We will also be developing more resources and support for using App Inventor as a learning tool. We look forward to working with you over the coming months to build the community of App Inventor educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We owe a large debt to our testers of the past few months; it’s been their feedback that’s given us the confidence for today’s announcement.   And we’re tremendously grateful to the folks who have been running their own system with the MIT JAR files.  Their experiences have been an invaluable source of information, and their work has been critical in keeping App Inventor alive while the MIT service was not yet available.    We also want to acknowledge the growing group of developers who are starting to explore the App Inventor source code.   They are the seeds of an open source community that we hope will take App Inventor beyond anything we could do by ourselves at MIT.   And our extreme gratitude and admiration goes to the Google App Inventor team who, even while their project transitions out of Google, have continued to share their expertise and the fruit of their hard work of the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join with us in helping the system move to its next phase as an MIT service.   You can learn about MIT App Inventor by visiting our new home at &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;http://appinventor.mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
