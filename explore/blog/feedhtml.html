 <title>The New App Inventor is Coming:  Update  -- Hunt bugs in App Inventor 2 and win prizes!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/hal/2013/11/new-app-inventor-coming-update-hunt-bugs-app-inventor-2-and-win-prizes</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;We’re continuing to make progress on the launch of the new App Inventor system (pre-release name is App Inventor 2), where the entire system runs in the browser (no more downloading of the blocks editor Java application).    We’re still on track to release it before the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who have been using App Inventor 2, and helping us test -- a big thank you!  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people who are still using App Inventor 1, we will keep the App Inventor 1 running as it is through the spring (and maybe longer).   But you might want to experiment with App Inventor 2 at &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;.  Keep in mind that projects currently cannot be transferred between App Inventor 1 and App Inventor 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re now at the point in our App Inventor 2 development where we need lots of testing.   So we’re holding a contest and inviting you to submit bug reports for a chance at a prize:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    The first prize is a Nexus 5 phone!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’ll also be awarding 10 second prizes and 20 third prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter, submit a report describing a bug in App Inventor 2 . The bug can be for MacOS, Windows, or GNU/Linux, but it must be for MIT App Inventor 2. Judging will be by the MIT App Inventor Team.   Here are some of the criteria we’ll be using:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this a real bug in App Inventor, as opposed to a problem with an individual program or a request for a new feature?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this a new bug, or something that has been already been reported on the forum?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is this an important bug?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Is the bug report well-written, with clear instructions for how we can verify it and duplicate it?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Does the bug concern one of our preferred areas of emphasis (see below)?
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadline for entries is one minute after midnight 12:01AM Eastern Standard Time on December 2, 2013.  You can start bug hunting now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To enter, you must complete both steps below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;Fill out the Report an Issue form on the App Inventor 2 page.   In the blank that asks you to describe the issue, write “Contest Entry” followed by a brief description of the bug.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Send email to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:appinventorcontest@mit.edu&quot;&gt;appinventorcontest@mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;, with a full description of the bug.  If you want to attach a project file that demonstrates the bug (highly recommended) attach it here.    Make sure to send the email from the same address you filled in on the form in step 1.  Also make the subject line of the email be the issue  (or the first few words of the issue) that you specified on the form.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can enter as many times as you like, but we’ll award at most one prize per person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;H*app*y Bug Hunting&lt;br /&gt;
The MIT App Inventor Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Areas of Emphasis&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re happy to consider bug reports about any aspect of App Inventor 2, but we will give special consideration to bugs that concern:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;large programs, that may exceed the timing or storage limitations of App Inventor (please attach aia files for these)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;the AI setup packages or the AI Companion
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;apps with multiple screens
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;bad documentation (typos, dead links, wrong information)
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>The New App Inventor is Coming!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/andrew/2013/10/new-app-inventor-coming</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor team is working hard on a new version of App Inventor, which we hope to release before the end of 2013.   You can try a preview of the new system now by visiting &lt;a href=&quot;http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;.   We are calling this preview &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2 Alpha&lt;/em&gt;, but after the official release, we’ll simply be calling it &lt;em&gt;App Inventor&lt;/em&gt;, and the current system will be then called &lt;em&gt;App Inventor Classic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The biggest difference between &lt;em&gt;App Inventor Classic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt; is that &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt; runs completely in the browser: you will not need Java in order to run App Inventor and there is no blocks editor to download.   Together with that, there are many minor changes in how the blocks look and, in some cases, what they are called.  Overall, programming in &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt; will be very much like programming in &lt;em&gt;App Inventor Classic&lt;/em&gt;:  you can see this for yourself by using the preview version.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projects created with &lt;em&gt;App Inventor Classic&lt;/em&gt; cannot run in &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt;, and vice versa.  We are not planning to automatically convert all &lt;em&gt;App Inventor Classic&lt;/em&gt; projects to &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt;, although we are exploring some tools that will let you convert your projects on your own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prior to the release of &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt;, we’ll also be making changes in the appinventor.mit.edu website and the App Inventor Forums to make it easier to find resources and to report bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people now using &lt;em&gt;App Inventor Classic&lt;/em&gt; (and especially people with plans to teach using it) we will keep the &lt;em&gt;App Inventor Classic&lt;/em&gt; system running, just as it is, at least through Summer 2014, although we will not be adding new features or continuing development on it, except for basic upkeep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For people now using &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt;, thank you for helping us test!   Keep in mind that the system is still experimental and under development.   In particular, expect to see incompatible changes over the coming weeks -- changes that will break your current &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt; projects or even cause them not to load.  We’re sorry for that inconvenience, but with our limited development resources, we cannot yet take on the task of ensuring backwards compatibility while meeting our development schedule.   In the meantime, if you have projects you want to keep current as &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt; evolves, we suggest that you save screenshots or instructions for yourself to use in reconstructing your project. Once &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt; is released, we’ll implement an automatic project upgrade mechanism for further changes, just as we have with &lt;em&gt;App Inventor Classic&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those people maintaining your own App Inventor releases, remember that the sources are available via &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/appinventor-sources/&quot;&gt;http://appinventor.mit.edu/appinventor-sources/&lt;/a&gt; on GitHub -- the current master branch is for App Inventor 2:  We encourage you to experiment with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are excited about releasing &lt;em&gt;App Inventor 2&lt;/em&gt;, and working hard to meet our end of year deadline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many thanks for your continued support and enthusiasm!&lt;br /&gt;
Andrew McKinney, Lead Developer&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp; The MIT App Inventor Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>URBAN Txt Students Using App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/joanie/2013/08/urban-txt-students-using-app-inventor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The URBAN TxT (urban Teens eXploring Technology) program seeks inner-city south L.A. students from 7th to 11th grade with an interest in technology. Many of the students in this program have parents who didn&#039;t attend college or even graduate high school. So far, the URBAN TxT program has been incredibly successful. Each of the 15-week summer terms start with an intensive course in team and leadership building.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“What I’ve found so fascinating is that the tech is just a tool to turn our teens into the leaders we know they can be,” Juan Vasquez, technology mentor at URBAN Txt, says. “It’s not really about the tech. It’s about how we get these kids to understand that they can go out and eat up this world … how we can tell kids ‘you’re meant to succeed … you’re built to succeed.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After these kids are taught how to be leaders and work on a team, they are introduced to HTML, CSS, and Javascript using a variety of online courseware. Once they are equipped with the foundational skills, they target problems in their communities that they&#039;re passionate about solving. After identifying these problems, the students are provided with mentors and volunteers whose goal is to help them explore different technologies that can be used to create the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the final projects students have created are: L.A. Volunteers, a sort of Match.com for teens — who need volunteering hours for high school graduation credits — and local charities and nonprofits, who need help and &lt;a href=&quot;http://satfighters.urbantxt.org/&quot;&gt;SAT Fighter&lt;/a&gt; (which students built using MIT App Inventor), a ninja-fighting game that helps teens prepare for their SAT tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Students of the program present their projects to everyone participating in a final demo day where they can win up to $3000 in prizes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Just seeing the hunger he has to compete in the world … that’s what I want every kid to have,” Vasquez says.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>App Inventor Boot Camp in Western Mass</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/joanie/2013/08/app-inventor-boot-camp-western-mass</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Inventor Boot Camp was a summer professional development experience for teachers to learn MIT App Inventor, a free visual blocks-based programming system for Android mobile devices that can be used to teach computer science concepts through the creative design of apps for smartphones and mobile devices. In this hands-on workshop, educators built their own apps and explored how to integrate app programming and computer science principles into their curricula in computing, technology, science, and math classes. The workshop included time to develop curriculum exercises and share them with colleagues, as well as begin to build a learning community of educators using App Inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting Tuesday, August 13, 2013 at 8:30 AM until Friday, August 16, 2013 at 1:00 PM, teachers gathered at the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center for an App Inventor Boot Camp: a 4 day workshop geared on teaching teachers about App Inventor and computational thinking. Mark Sherman, PhD candidate at UMass Lowell and part of the MIT App Inventor Training Corps led the workshop with assistance from myself and James DeFilippo and Rajia Aziz: both undergraduates at UMass Lowell in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/&quot;&gt;Engaging Computing Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blogs/instructors.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A photo of the instructors (minus Rajia who had to leave early) of the Bootcamp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 15 educators participated in the Boot Camp, including teachers and professors from middle schools, high schools, and even colleges. Participants had a mix of backgrounds, from very strong programming experience to none at all. But by the end of the bootcamp, everyone was able to build apps and understand basic computing concepts by using App Inventor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blogs/everyone.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;A photo of all of the teachers and instructors from the last day.&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As part of a project to get participants using App Inventor and integrating the tool and computing principles into different content areas, participants sorted themselves into groups of 2-3 and made an app for an infusion activity. Each app needed to serve an educational purpose that combined App Inventor and the computational thinking it affords with another subject area. Participants also wrote  worksheets that complemented the apps. Some of the apps were: a College Tour of Western Mass colleges, a Physics app about gravity on Earth and other planets, a growing a plant app that teaches a bit about plants, a Spanish teaching app, an app that teaches and tests reading a ruler, and an app that teaches about computer/technology costs. All the apps, with source code and descriptions can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/#page%3DFindApps%26query%3D%257B%2522text%2522%253A%255B%2522mghpcc2013%2522%255D%257D&quot;&gt;App Inventor Gallery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blogs/apps.jpeg&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two of the infusion apps that participants in the Boot Camp created&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a great experience, learning and teaching App Inventor. Thank you so much to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mghpcc.org/&quot;&gt;MGHPCC&lt;/a&gt; for hosting and for &lt;a href=&quot;http://caite.cs.umass.edu/&quot;&gt;CAITE&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://expandingcomputing.cs.umass.edu/&quot;&gt;ECEP&lt;/a&gt; for sponsoring. And thanks again to &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/people.html&quot;&gt;MIT&#039;s App Inventor Group&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.uml.edu/ecg/&quot;&gt;UMass Lowell&#039;s Engaging Computing Group&lt;/a&gt; for providing the instructors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Chicago Summer of Learning features App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/joanie/2013/07/chicago-summer-learning-features-app-inventor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/sites/all/files/blogs/AppInvention.png&quot; style=&quot;float:right&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This summer of 2013, thousands of young Chicagoans will continue learning while school is out, thanks to Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s citywide Chicago Summer of Learning initiative, the largest coordinated summer learning effort in the country. Summer of Learning will specifically focus learning activities around science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics.  The City of Chicago teamed up with the MacArthur Foundation and Mozilla to be the first city to pilot a citywide digital “badge” system that visually represents and rewards students’ achievements. The badges in the Chicago Summer of Learning will recognize learning across all of the summer programs in the initiative, whether at a park, museum, library or online course, giving learners digital credentials that communicate the skills that they have developed. The badges the youth earn will unlock additional learning opportunities and challenges. All of the badge information can be carried back to schools and job fairs during the school year. These badges are earned by completing activities in various pathways available from the Chicago Summer of Learning hub site. App Invention using App Inventor is one of these pathways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arun Saigal and I went out to Chicago to lead a few workshops to Chicago youth and mentors who are part of this summer&#039;s Chicago Summer of Learning. Some of the students involved with CSOL come to the drop in center located at DePaul University every day for a Digital Divas program run through the Digital Youth Network. Others come every week wth their summer camp through the Chicago Park District. Some students are not involved in any camps but interested in learning as much as they can over the summer. Here are some photos from our workshops.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Democratizing the mobile world with MIT App Inventor</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/leoburd/2013/07/democratizing-mobile-world-mit-app-inventor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built with the mission to democratize app creation for and by all, &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT App Inventor&lt;/a&gt; is a graphical tool that turns media consumers into active and critical participants of the mobile world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As portable devices become ubiquitous, mobile apps are the new Web. Literally bringing data and connectivity to our fingertips, apps are increasingly becoming our primary entryway to local news, weather and market reports, email, digital books, movies, interactive games and socially-relevant information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But like in the early days of the Web, when site creation required highly specialized skills, app creation is still the domain of a small elite of programmers and designers. This is where MIT App Inventor comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By combining visual LEGO-like blocks together on the screen, App Inventor users, even those with no programming experience, can create apps for health, entertainment, education, business and anything else that comes to mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/no_text_while_driving_0.png&quot; alt=&quot;App Inventor blocks&quot; style=&quot;display: block; float:right; width:400px; padding: 5px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Programming with App Inventor is like combining LEGO blocks on the screen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Inventor is currently being taught by universities, schools and community technology centers around the world. As part of those initiatives, students not only acquire important technology skills such as computer programming, but also have the opportunity to apply computational thinking concepts to science and other meaningful contexts. Examples of student projects include a &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/stories/app-womens-health.html&quot;&gt;mobile app to educate women about the Pap test&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hfoss.org/index.php/news/38/15/Trinity-Students-Develop-Android-App-to-Aid-Haitian-Relief-Efforts&quot;&gt;systems to support grassroots organizations in Haiti&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/stories/bunny-bolt-location-sensing-outdoor-fitness-game.html&quot;&gt;games to foster healthy lifestyles&lt;/a&gt;. Outside the formal academic realm, App Inventor is being used in youth programs to &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/stories/east-palo-alto-girls-create-app-clean-graffiti-trash.html&quot;&gt;engage underserved girls with careers in science and technology&lt;/a&gt;, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.csev.org/ultimos-proyectos/-/asset_publisher/B3z1/content/unx-comunidad-iberoamericana-de-formacion-y-emprendimiento-online?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.csev.org%2Fultimos-proyectos%3Fp_p_id%3D101_INSTANCE_B3z1%26p_p_lifecycle%3D0%26p_p_state%3Dnormal%26p_p_mode%3Dview%26p_p_col_id%3Dcolumn-1%26p_p_col_count%3D1&quot;&gt;massive open online courses to foster mobile workforce development and entrepreneurship throughout Latin America&lt;/a&gt;, and in many other initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/technovation-28-1024x681_0.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Girls using App Inventor&quot; style=&quot;display: block; float:left;width:400px; padding: 10px&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://newscenter.lbl.gov/feature-stories/2012/04/03/berkeley-lab-invests-in-the-community/&quot;&gt;High school girls creating an app as part of the Technovation Challenge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brainchild of MIT Professor Hal Abelson, App Inventor started as a collaboration with Google in 2009. In late 2011, the project came to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mobilelearning.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;MIT Center for Mobile Learning&lt;/a&gt; and was released as free and open source a few months later. Currently, App Inventor has over 900,000 users and has spawned nearly two million projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although those numbers are already impressive, the MIT Center for Mobile Learning is now working to reach out to a much larger fraction of the 5 Billion mobile phone users of the planet. In order to do so, the next version of App Inventor is going to bring a more intuitive interface and will be available in multiple languages besides English.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, much more will be needed to turn App Inventor&#039;s democratizing potential into reality. The example apps listed above are a good starting point, but they are still a minority. From a technology perspective, if the plan is to support the creation of personally and socially meaningful apps for and by everyone, we will have to make sure that App Inventor provides the core building blocks for the most desired projects and is friendly enough for people to feel comfortable using those blocks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, even with usability improvements, the process of creating apps is not a trivial one.  It requires individuals to conceptualize their new app, put together a simple prototype, test it out and repeat the process until they are happy with the outcome. Part of that can be done in isolation, but it is most likely to happen when inventors-to-be are provided with the proper space, orientation and nurturing environment of a local group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a way, none of those technical and non-technical tasks can or should be done by MIT alone.  In order to be successful, they will depend on strong collaborations among technical education institutions and field organizations that assume true ownership over App Inventor, make sure it enables relevant projects in their region, and support their long term sustainability. A few of these collaborations are already happening, but we need more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This blog entry is an invitation to all who are interested in democratizing the apps creation world. If you are an educator, check the App Inventor tutorials and resources on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/teach.html&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. If you are a software developer, join the &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu/appinventor-sources/&quot;&gt;App Inventor Open Source group&lt;/a&gt;. If you have specific questions or are already doing related work in the field, just send us an email! &lt;/p&gt;

I recently teamed up with CS teacher Kristin Violette to write an article for the July issue of &lt;em&gt;CSTA Voice&lt;/em&gt;. In the article we chronicle how Kristin&#039;s students at Newtown High School in Connecticut have used App Inventor to forge a personalized connection between CS and their local community. Kristin and I will be presenting at the CSTA Annual Conference in Quincy, MA on July 16th. We hope to see you there!  &lt;a href=&quot;http://csta.acm.org/Communications/sub/CSTAVoice_Files/csta_voice_07_2013.pdf&quot; style=&quot;width:300;height:100;&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Read the full article...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>$200K Keck Grant for Appinventor.org</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/blogs/caitlin/2013/04/200k-keck-grant-appinventororg</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Wolber and the University of San Francisco received a $200,000 grant from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wmkeck.org/grant-programs/undergraduate-program/grant-abstracts/2012/1360-undergraduate-edu-grant-abstracts-university-of-san-francisco.html&quot;&gt;W.M. Keck Foundation&lt;/a&gt; to launch the &lt;a href=&quot;http://democratizecomputing.org/&quot;&gt;Democratize Computing Lab at USF&lt;/a&gt; .  The Lab’s mission is to break down the programmer divide and radically broaden and diversify the pool of software creators. The Lab will be using App inventor to allow beginners to build useful apps within days and experience the joy of computing and real-world problem-solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolber has been involved with App Inventor since its inception at Google in 2009, and co-authored a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/App-Inventor-Create-Your-Android/dp/1449397484&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; with App Inventor creator Hal Abelson and two of the Google engineers on the App Inventor team (including Mills College professor Ellen Spertus). His site &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.org/&quot;&gt;appinventor.org&lt;/a&gt;, which provides video lessons and course materials for students and teachers, recently received its millionth hit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Lab is involved with a number of App Inventor education projects for providing beginners with an entry-way into the world of programming. Wolber and his students are completing and refining the “course-in-a-box” materials for students and teachers on the appinventor.org site. They’re also working with MIT and UMass-Lowell on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://gallery.appinventor.mit.edu/&quot;&gt;App Inventor Community Gallery&lt;/a&gt;, a site where students, teachers, and developers share apps and learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wolber will continue to direct the Lab in the fall while on Sabbatical at MIT, where he’ll be serving as a visiting faculty member and working with Hal Abelson and the App Inventor team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>
