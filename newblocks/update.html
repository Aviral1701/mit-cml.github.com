<h3>Welcome to App Inventor "newblocks" pilot, Update Information</h3>

<h4>Information for version “nb104”</h4>

<p>
  Numerous changes, including new block colors. Option to show warnings on blocks.
  You can now create blocks by typing, similar to App Inventor Classic. When connected
  to the companion app you can change blocks without having the whole app reloaded
  on the phone. Errors detected on blocks by the companion will be flagged.
</p>
<p>
  <b>IMPORTANT:</b> Projects you export will now end in a ".aia" extension instead of
  ".zip" (aia for "App Inventor App"). If you import projects, they must end in .aia
  (note: The internal format remains ZIP).
</p>
<p>
  You will want to update the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/newblocks/MITNewBlocksCompanion.apk">MIT
  NewBlocks Companion</a>, though the old version will work (though errors in blocks
  won't always be flagged).
</p>
<h4>Information for version “nb103”</h4>

<p>Version “nb103” is a minor bugfix update that causes MIT App
   Inventor version 2 to work properly with Firefox. You do not need
   to update the MIT New Blocks Companion if you already did so for
   version “nb102.”</p>

<h4>Information for version “nb102”</h4>

<p>Welcome to the “nb102” version of App Inventor Newblocks. As of
  this version we will begin to deprecate the “newblocks” terminology in
  favor of “MIT App Inventor 2”.</p>

<p>This version requires a new version of the
  <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/newblocks/MITNewBlocksCompanion.apk">MIT
                             NewBlocks Companion</a>.</p>

<p>This version is a further refinement of the new blocks editing code
   for MIT App Inventor. Right click on the blocks editor background
   to see some new features for arranging your blocks. You can also
   use Chrome to “Zoom” in and out to make building larger apps
   easier. This version should also work in Firefox (previous versions
   did not always display the blocks correctly).</p>

<p>This version adds a “Connect to Emulator” button when in the blocks
   editor. As its name implies, this is a facility that will let you
   debug your apps using the emulator. Note that this functionality is
   still being worked on and isn’t finished (or polished that well
   either!). In particular the UI will likely change.</p>

<p>To use the Emulator you should install the Android SDK or you may
   be able to use the App Inventor setup tools version of the
   emulator. In either case you will need to invoke the Android
   Emulator manually (for now). We recommend using the Android SDK and
   following the instructions in the SDK documentation. <b>YOU DO NOT
   NEED TO INSTALL ECLIPSE</b>. The SDK itself is sufficient. You can also
   start an emulator for any recent version of Android. We recommend
   using Gingerbread (2.3) or later.</p>

<p>Once you have an emulator running, you need to install the MIT
   NewBlocks Companion in the emulator. You can use the “adb” command
   to do this. In particular the command is:</p>

<code>
  “adb install MITNewBlocksCompanion.apk”
</code>

<p>This assumes that you are working in the directory where you
   downloaded the Companion. You can use an absolute path to the APK
   file as well.</p>

<p>Once you have done this, you can use the emulator for App Inventor
   Development. There is one additional catch. Each time you start the
   emulator you should issue the command:</p>

<code>
  “adb forward tcp:8001 tcp:8001”
</code>

<p>This sets up the network path for the Companion app. Once the
   emulator is running and you have issued the adb command above,
   start the Companion App in the emulator. It should recognize that
   it is running in the emulator and not put up any buttons, etc. You
   should now (finally!) be able to click the “Connect to Emulator”
   button in the blocks editor. Your App should now appear in the
   Companion on the emulator, if all went well.</p>

<p>Obviously we will streamline this process in the future.</p>

<p>Enjoy. Please send any feedback via the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/newblocks/feedback.html" target="_blank">Feedback Form</a> at the top
   of the page (in MIT App Inventor).</p>

<p>Happy Inventing!<br />
