<h3>Welcome to App Inventor &quot;newblocks&quot; pilot</h3>
<p>
  Welcome to the pre-Alpha test of the next generation of App
  Inventor. The most significant change in this version is the moving
  of the blocks editor into the browser instead of residing in a
  separate Java program.</p>
<p>
  A lot about this new version is very very cool. A lot about this
  version is very very unstable! Even the exact name has not been fully
  decided. Colloquially we have referred to this version as
  &quot;newblocks.&quot;</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind that this is very much a work in progress. We believe
  this version works well enough to give you a feel for where we are
  going, and we welcome feedback. However it is NOT SUITABLE FOR
  PRODUCTION OR CLASS USE.</p>
<p>
  This version is also undergoing continuous update and improvement. Do
  not be surprised if it looks different from day to day. We know that
  not all of it works (though do let us know when you find something
  broken). We may also break it (accidentally) from time to time.</p>
<p>
  Access to this version is by invitation only. Chances are if you are
  reading this note, you have been invited and have been added to our
  list of allowed users. But keep in mind that not everyone can use this
  version (yet).</p>
<p>
  Finally. Thank You for volunteering to help us improve App Inventor!
  We very much appreciate your help and feedback!</p>
<h4>Only wireless device connection is supported: You will need the
  new MIT NewBlocks Companion App</h4>
<p>
  You will need to download the MITNewBlocksCompanion.apk to do
  incremental development. This app is not available in the Google Play
  Store. You will need to <a class="c11"
                             href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/newblocks/MITNewBlocksCompanion.apk">download
    it here</a>&nbsp;and &ldquo;side load&rdquo; it into your device (if
  you need instructions on how to do so, please contact us). We do not
  yet have an emulator that works with this version, but we are planning
  on having one. Do not worry if you already have the MIT AICompanion
  app on your device because this newer version can co-exist with the
  version that you already have.</p>

<p>
  <h4>Testing Instructions</h4>
<p>
  For this testing phase we are primarily interested in whether the
  blocks language have any problems, for example can you create the same
  application in the current version of AppInventor with this new
  version.</p>
<p>
  You will definitely notice many changes in this new version for
  example, we now have &ldquo;Local Variables&rdquo;, and missing
  functionality such as &ldquo;Type Blocking&rdquo;. Please remember
  that this is still a work-in-progress and you will see new
  functionality appear.</p>
<p>
  Please start by: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Recode applications that you have created, acquired or have used
    in your classes and see if they still work. Also, if you could send us
    a zip file of your application that would be helpful too. If you
    can&rsquo;t find any applications there is a collection
    <a href="https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2IG3uhfSus-UXpNRllvYjNfNk0&amp;usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
  <li>Code your apps using local variables.</li>
  <li>Create application that use multiple screens.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Give us your Feedback</h4>
<p>
  If you notice or experience any problems, bugs or just want to make a
  suggestion please use
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1kv6i3F4DeYBycyvfwE5pdbRRQ7IwSkhuzwNiqVtJMHM/viewform">this
    form</a>&nbsp;to submit your response.</p>
<h4>Known Issues List:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This list is not complete.</li>
  <li>Blocks do not properly appear in some versions of Firefox.</li>
  <li>When you are connected to the Companion App and you modify your
    project, the whole project reloads and resets on your device.</li>
  <li>Changes on your device only happen when you are in the
    &quot;Blocks&quot; panel (not the &quot;Designer&quot;) panel.</li>
  <li>...</li>
