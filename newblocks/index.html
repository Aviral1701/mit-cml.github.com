<h3>Welcome to App Inventor "newblocks" pilot</h3>

<p>
  Welcome to the pre-Alpha test of the next generation of App
  Inventor. The most significant change in this version is the moving of the
  blocks editor into the browser instead of residing in a separate Java
  program.</p>
<p>
  A lot about this new version is very very cool. A lot about this
  version is very very unstable! Even the exact name that we will call
  it is not fully decided. Colloquially we have referred to this
  version as "newblocks."</p>
<p>
  Keep in mind that this is very much a work in progress. We believe
  this version works well enough to give you a feel for where we are
  going, and we welcome feedback. However it is NOT SUITABLE FOR
  PRODUCTION OR CLASS USE.</p>
<p>
  It is also undergoing continuous update and improvement. Do not be
  surprised if it looks different from day to day. We know that not
  all of it works (though do let us know when you find something
  broken). We may also break it (accidentally) from time to time.</p>
<p>
  Access to this version is by invitation only. Chances are if you are
  reading this note, you have been invited and have been added to our
  list of allowed users. But keep in mind that not everyone can use
  this version (yet).</p>
<p>
  Finally. Thank You for volunteering to help us improve App Inventor!
  We very much appreciate your help and feedback!</p>

<h4>You will need the new MIT NewBlocks Companion App</h4>
<p>
  You will need to download
  the <a href="MITNewBlocksCompanion.apk">MITNewBlocksCompanion.apk</a>
  to do incremental development. This app is not available in the
  Google Play Store. You will need
  to <a href="MITNewBlocksCompanion.apk">download it here</a> and side
  load it into your device. Only wireless connectivity is currently
  supported. We also do not yet have an emulator version, but we are
  planning on having one.</p>
<p>The Newblocks Companion can (and does) co-exist with the MIT
  AICompanion App, so you can have both on your device without
  difficulty.</p>

<h4>Known Issues List:</h4>

<ul style="disc">

<li>This list is not complete.</li>
<li>Blocks do not properly appear in some versions of Firefox.</li>
<li>When you are connected to the Companion App and you modify your
  project, the whole project reloads and resets on your device.</li>
<li>Changes on your device only happen when you are in the "Blocks"
  panel (not the "UI") panel.</li>
