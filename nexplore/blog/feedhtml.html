 <title>Ed Week features App Inventor as tool for engaging students</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/ed-week-features-app-inventor-tool-engaging-students</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Check it out: Ed Week ran a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.edweek.org/dd/articles/2012/06/13/03mobile.h05.html&quot;&gt;feature article on App Inventor&lt;/a&gt; and the power of teaching students how to build mobile apps. Many excellent programs are described in the article, including &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthapplab.com/&quot;&gt;Youth APPLab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://iridescentlearning.org/programs/technovation-challenge/&quot;&gt;Technovation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youthradio.org/&quot;&gt;Youth Radio&lt;/a&gt;, and others. My favorite quote is from an eighth grade girl: &quot;These programs expand your view on careers like computer science and engineering and show the fun in them.&quot; This is what we are all about at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning!&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Welcome to the new App Inventor website!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/welcome-new-app-inventor-website</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello again,&lt;br /&gt;
After a bit of a hiatus, this blog is back in action. I was waiting to post a new entry until we had successfully rolled out the NEW WEBSITE! Now that it&#039;s here, I&#039;d like to draw your attention to a few things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The App Inventor website hosted at MIT (appinventor.mit.edu) is actually three separate sites: the &quot;explore&quot; site, the &quot;teach&quot; site, and the &quot;service&quot; site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#C95828&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;service site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the site you already know and love as it hosts the actual App Inventor software where you build your own app projects. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#9AAE47&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;explore site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is geared toward the casual visitor as well as the veteran app builder. We will post news, project updates, stories about people using App Inventor, and things of that nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://teach.appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#73B3DF&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;teach site&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or educators&#039; site, is an oasis of information and support for people who are using App Inventor with students -- of any age and in any setting. This is the area where I will be focusing much of my energy over the next several months, as we build this site to include more education materials, and as we build the community by engaging people in joining in the exchange of ideas around App Inventor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your feedback is valued and welcome! Please &lt;a href=&quot;/contact&quot;&gt;let us know&lt;/a&gt; your thoughts and suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, I&#039;d like to let you know about the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Invitational&lt;/em&gt; App Inventor Summit on July 13/14 in Cambridge, MA. This meeting is intended to set the agenda for the App Inventor project for the next year. For more information, and to see how you can apply to participate, see the &lt;a href=&quot;../summit&quot;&gt;Summit Information page&lt;/a&gt;. Applications close June 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#039;s all for now. Happy inventing...&lt;br /&gt;
Shay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>App Inventor helping to bridge gap in numbers of CS Majors</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/app-inventor-helping-bridge-gap-numbers-cs-majors</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello Inventors,  One of our main goals at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning is to encourage greater participation in computing from a wider and more varied assortment of people. App Inventor does this by inherently fostering personal creativity with technology. I was pleased to see App Inventor mentioned in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&quot;&gt;recent blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Maggie Johnson, Google&#039;s Director of Education, in which she writes about the resurgence of CS Education: &lt;a href=&quot;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&quot;&gt;http://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2012/04/joining-forces-to-support-computer.html&lt;/a&gt;  little by little...&lt;br /&gt;

 <title>Please help up test the new site for sharing App Inventor projects</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/please-help-test-new-site-sharing-app-inventor-projects</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ever since App Inventor was launched, there have been many requests  for a site where people can exhibit and share their App Inventor  work.   MIT and  University of Massachusetts at  Lowell are collaborating on creating such a Gallery site, which  we hope to launch later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now, we are looking for volunteer testers to provide  feedback on the site and to help shake it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the App Inventor service was released from MIT, and before that  from Google, our testers were essential in getting the system  launched.   And the same will be true for this Gallery.   So we&#039;re  forward to your active -- and critically important -- participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For details, see the &lt;a href=&quot;https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/appinventor/2t7v0svkCq0&quot;&gt; post&lt;/a&gt; by Prof. Martin of UMass Lowell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can  sign up to be a tester by completing the form at&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://tinyurl.com/aig-beta-request&quot;&gt;http://tinyurl.com/aig-beta-request&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Hog Wild for App Inventor!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/hog-wild-app-inventor</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello App Inventors, Things are moving right along here at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning. The community continues to grow and we have now topped the 90,000 mark for the number unique accounts on the App Inventor service! We have several initiatives underway to bring you new materials and learning opportunities. Stay tuned to this blog and to our &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum/index.html&quot;&gt;Educators&#039; forum&lt;/a&gt; for updates.  Today I&#039;d like to share an entertaining story... &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &quot;A science lab doesn&#039;t need to have a ceiling... a science lab doesn&#039;t even need to have walls!&quot;...&lt;/em&gt; Gina Hall McCarley, an Alabama high school teacher, shared a wonderful &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories/wild-hogs-app&quot;&gt;story highlighting the usefulness of App Inventor as a tool for science exploration&lt;/a&gt;: tracking wildlife in a local forest. Using App Inventor, students programmed a simple data collection tool for documenting wild hog populations, to help scientists better understand a local environmental issue that has real-world implications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/stories?page=1&quot;&gt;Read more on the App Inventor stories pages&lt;/a&gt;, share these stories with other educators, and become inspired to help students create their own mobile tools for deepening learning across the curriculum.  Do you have a story to share? &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/contact&quot;&gt;Send it to us&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>App Inventor Community continues to grow!</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/app-inventor-community-continues-grow</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello App Inventor Educators! My name is Shaileen Pokress (“Shay”). I have just gotten started in my new position as Education Community Manager at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning. I am working with the App Inventor Team to facilitate sharing of ideas and materials in support of using App Inventor for learning. Whether you’re involved in informal settings or are using App Inventor in the classroom, I invite you to join with us as we build this community of educators.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/developers-blogs/hal/2012/mar/announcing-mit-app-inventor-open-beta-preview&quot;&gt;App Inventor was re-launched by MIT&lt;/a&gt; just two weeks ago, and already over 70,000 unique users have registered! We anticipate a great deal of activity over the coming months as this community begins to take advantage of this powerful tool for engaging learners in tinkering with technology.  That’s all for now. Sign up for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://beta.appinventor.mit.edu/forum/index.html&quot;&gt;App Inventor Educators’ Google Group&lt;/a&gt; to join our ongoing discussion.  -- Shay Pokress&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Announcing:  MIT App Inventor  Open Beta Preview</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/announcing-mit-app-inventor-open-beta-preview</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MIT Center for Mobile Learning is delighted to announce that we’re meeting our goal of making MIT App Inventor available as a public service in the first quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past two months, we have been conducting a closed test of the system for an increasing number of testers, and we’ve currently scaled to 5000 testers.   Today, we’re taking the next step, and opening the MIT App Inventor service to everyone.   All you will need is a Google ID for log-in (for example, a Gmail account).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;App Inventor will now be suitable for any use, including running classes. But please be aware that this is the first time the system will be under load from a large number of users, so there may be bumps and adjustments as the load increases.   For now, we suggest that you maintain backup copies of important apps, as we see how things go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there are glitches and minor errors and lots of room for improvement.  We’ll be turning our attention to these improvements, once we have more experience with running the system at scale. We will also be developing more resources and support for using App Inventor as a learning tool. We look forward to working with you over the coming months to build the community of App Inventor educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We owe a large debt to our testers of the past few months; it’s been their feedback that’s given us the confidence for today’s announcement.   And we’re tremendously grateful to the folks who have been running their own system with the MIT JAR files.  Their experiences have been an invaluable source of information, and their work has been critical in keeping App Inventor alive while the MIT service was not yet available.    We also want to acknowledge the growing group of developers who are starting to explore the App Inventor source code.   They are the seeds of an open source community that we hope will take App Inventor beyond anything we could do by ourselves at MIT.   And our extreme gratitude and admiration goes to the Google App Inventor team who, even while their project transitions out of Google, have continued to share their expertise and the fruit of their hard work of the past three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Please join with us in helping the system move to its next phase as an MIT service.   You can learn about MIT App Inventor by visiting our new home at &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventor.mit.edu&quot;&gt;http://appinventor.mit.edu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>MIT App Inventor mid-January status update</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/mit-app-inventor-mid-january-status-update</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&#039;s been three months since we started work on App Inventor at the MIT Center for Mobile Learning and three weeks since Google&#039;s public service went offline.  Here&#039;s brief progress report on the replacement public service we&#039;ll be deploying at MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far (knock on wood) our development effort is on track for releasing the MIT Public App Inventor Service in the first quarter of this year.  While unexpected issues can always arise, we&#039;re guardedly optimistic that people who plan to run App Inventor courses or workshops can anticipate being able to use the MIT service by mid-April.  But please check the postings at this site about the status of the public server before you make firm commitments.  Remember that, as a backup, you can run your own App Inventor server using our JAR files as described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some other developments and things we’re working on:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some users of Google App Inventor didn&#039;t notice the warning that they would need to download their projects in order to preserve them after the shutdown of the Google service, and there have been several cries for help from distraught users.  Though some last-minute heroics, the Google App Inventor team was able to package up everyone&#039;s projects and store them in a zip file in their &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com&quot;&gt;Google Docs&lt;/a&gt; account.  Google can&#039;t guarantee that all projects survived, but at least 95% of them did.  So if you didn&#039;t download your projects in time, check your Docs files; and give some thanks to the Google team for making the extra effort to do this at a really busy time during the transition to MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here at MIT, testing with the MIT experimental service is going well.  We&#039;ve just admitted 300 more testers, making 700 testers in all, and there&#039;s a long waiting list.  To get on the waiting list, read the information at &lt;a href=&quot;http://appinventoredu.mit.edu/developers-blogs/hal/2011/dec/help-test-mit-prototype-app-inventor-service&quot;&gt;Help test the MIT prototype service&lt;/a&gt; and fill out the form.  We&#039;ll work through the waiting list as fast as the service becomes stable enough to handle the load. Our work at MIT over the past two weeks has focused on improving the “build server” that packages apps for the phone, and we&#039;ll be watching that carefully over the coming weeks as we add more testers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fappinventoredu.mit.edu%2Fdevelopers-blogs%2Fandrew%2F2011%2Fnov%2Frunning-your-own-app-inventor-service&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNGPw1T_JUk2MLJzAdqk0E5IhC9Fmw&quot;&gt;Java Archive (JAR) distribution&lt;/a&gt;, which lets people set up their own small-scale App Inventor services, is also in good shape.  There&#039;s a lot of use by individuals and also by classes: the JARs are our temporary solution for people who need to run classes before the MIT Public Service becomes available.  One issue that has surfaced with the JARs is that, when there are more than a few students, App Inventor daily usage can out run Google App Engine&#039;s quota on free service.  If you&#039;re in that situation, try turning on App Engine billing for a day and seeing how high your load is.  People who have done that report that the App Engine cost turns out to be a couple of dollars per week, something that should be tolerable until the free MIT service comes online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For developers and hobbyists, the big news this week is that Google has just released the App Inventor code as Free and Open Source Software, as described &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fappinventoredu.mit.edu%2Fdevelopers-blogs%2Fhal%2F2012%2Fjan%2Fgoogle-and-mit-announce-open-sourcing-app-inventor-code&amp;amp;sa=D&amp;amp;sntz=1&amp;amp;usg=AFQjCNFOKt0orpiWvUxjYFQAJaTkZjzDBA&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.  We hope to nurture a rich open-source community from MIT, but we won&#039;t start doing that until our public service is running.  For now, we’ll leave it everyone is free to experiment with the code as they wish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In summary, three weeks into our projected three-month transition period, we&#039;re on track.  If we make our goal smoothly, it will be with enormous gratitude to Google: to Google Research for providing the funding to create the Center for Mobile Learning, and to the Google App Inventor Team for a simply monumental effort last fall to port App Inventor to the open-source implementation, that we are now finishing up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Google and MIT announce open sourcing of the App Inventor code</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/google-and-mit-announce-open-sourcing-app-inventor-code</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and MIT are pleased to announce the initial free and open-source release from Google of the App Inventor source code at &lt;a href=&quot;http://code.google.com/p/app-inventor-releases/&quot;&gt;http://code.google.com/p/app-inventor-releases/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#039;s little supporting documentation yet, and we’re not accepting contributions to the code now.  That will happen later, after the MIT Center of Mobile Learning opens their App Inventor server to the public.  We hope to nurture a robust and active open-source project eventually, but for now we don&#039;t want to distract the MIT developers from their efforts to complete and deploy the large-scale public server.  In the meantime, we’ll update the code periodically to match what’s running at the latest MIT experimental system.  We&#039;ve also created a Google Group here for people working with the code to relate their experiences with the code, ask questions, help each other, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People who create modifications from this code base are free to use the term “App Inventor” and the puzzle-piece Android logo in their work.   MIT will be releasing its own versions under the name “MIT App Inventor”, which is reserved for the systems actually coming from MIT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the code, and Happy Inventing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</description>

 <title>Help test the MIT prototype App Inventor Service</title>
 <link>http://explore.appinventor.mit.edu/content/help-test-mit-prototype-app-inventor-service</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden view-mode-rss&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://mitmobilelearning.org/&quot;&gt;Center for Mobile Learning&lt;/a&gt; is planning to deploy a public App Inventor service some time in the first quarter of 2012, to replace the service that Google will be turning off at the end of December. We&#039;ve just launched an experimental prototype, and we&#039;re looking for people to help test the service. We&#039;ll start by opening the service to a small number of testers, and we&#039;ll add more testers as we gain experience over the next several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep in mind that this is an experimental prototype, not suitable for serious use like teaching classes in the interim period before the MIT service is formally released. For that kind of interim use, please see &lt;a href=&quot;/developers-blogs/andrew/2011/nov/running-your-own-app-inventor-service&quot;&gt;Running Your own App Inventor Service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We expect the prototype service to be up and down without warning, and to be unreliable about saving user apps. If you can tolerate that kind of unreliability, we&#039;d appreciate you helping us test. The better we test, the sooner we can make the new service publicly available.&lt;/p&gt;
