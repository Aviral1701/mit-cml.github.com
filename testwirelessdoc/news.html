         The Testwireless App Inventor server has been updated. It is
         now up-to-date with the current beta release (v130a). The
         most noticeable change you will see on the wireless side will
         be that the "Connect to Phone" button is gone from the blocks
         editor. You don't need it! Just enter your code on the phone
         (or scan the QR Code) and the blocks editor will pick up on
         it.
       </p>
       <p>
         We are getting very close to releasing this code on our
         normal (beta.appinventor.mit.edu) server. In the next few
         days I will be putting up a short survey that I would
         appreciate it if you could fill out. I'm interested in
         knowing what phones you have used the wireless code on and
         how well it worked (or didn't!). I'm also interested in
         general feedback. Thanks for your help!
       </p>
       <p>
         Note: This version requires the newest Companion App (version 1.10L).

       <p>
         Version 1.10L has been uploaded to the Play Store and is also
         available here
         (<a href="AppInventorCompanion.apk">AppInventorCompanion.apk</a>). If
         you have selected automatic update in the Google Play Store,
         you will receive this version automatically. Otherwise,
         please upgrade from the store or download it here.
       </p>
       <p>
         <b>YOU WILL NEED THIS VERSION IN A FEW DAYS AS THE OLDER
         VERSION WILL NOT WORK AFTER WE UPDATE THE SERVER</b>. In a
         few days we will update the testwireless server to the latest
         code that is currently on beta.appinventor.mit.edu. This will
         likely be the last version before the public release of
         wireless functionality.
       </p>
       <p>
         You may notice that the icon for this version as the word
         "Legacy" written across it. That is because the version used
         for the public release will be distributed from the Google
         Play account of the Center for Mobile Learning. This
         testwireless version is distributed from my personal
         account. When we do the public release you will need to
         download the app from the Play Store manually. It will not
         auto update. It is also possible to have both versions
         installed at the same time. As they have the same name, the
         "Legacy" word will be how you can tell them apart.

         App Inventor Companion App version 1.9 has been uploaded to
         the Play Store and is available here
         (<a href="AppInventorCompanion.apk">AppInventorCompanion.apk</a>). This
         version supports the "Package for Phone->Download to Connected
         Phone" feature. For this to work the Companion App needs to be running
         and connected to the blocks editor.</p>
       <p>
         <b>Version 1.9 of the Companion App supports the Samsung Galaxy S III</b>.

         We have installed a new wireless release. This release
         requires Companion App version 1.8 which has been in the Play
         Store since October 26. If you haven't already updated the
         App, you will need to do so now. You can also download it
         directly
         at <a href="AppInventorCompanion.apk">AppInventorCompanion.apk</a>.

         We have renamed the App Inventor Debug App to be the "App
         Inventor Companion." It also has a new logo, an Android with
         a WiFi symbol on his belly!  We will be updating the software
         on this server sometime early next week. You will need the
         updated Companion App in order to use the newer software.
       <p>
         You can download the new app here or from the Play Store. If
         you originally obtained the Debug App from the Play Store and
         checked "Automatic Update" you should have already received
         the new version or will shortly.
       <p>
         You can also download it directly <a href="AppInventorCompanion.apk">AppInventorCompanion.apk</a>.

         We have released a new version of the MIT App Inventor Debug
         App. This version no longer expires. However
         it <strong>is</strong> tied to the version of the MIT App
         Inventor Server it was built for. Therefore it will stop
         working when we upgrade the server. To avoid problems, we
         will announce ahead of time when we will be doing updates and
         we will have the new version of the MIT App Inventor Debug
         App available for download both on the server and in the Play
         Store ahead of the update. The new version of the App will
         work with the current server so you can upgrade as soon as we
         put up the new version.
         </p>
       <p>
         If you download the App from the Google Play Store, we
         recommend that you check the "Allow automatic updates" option
         on the installation screen.  You will then always have the
         most up-to-date version of the application provided your
         phone has an Internet connection periodically.

         <b>This version changes the way you connect to your
         phone.</b> The "Connect Wireless" button is gone. Instead
         under the connect menu there is now a "WiFi" option which
         does the same thing. Plus, if you exit the Debugger App you
         can start a new one and connect to the same blocks editor
         (previously you had to quit and restart the blocks
         editor). Just start a new debugger app on your phone. The
         newest version has a "Restart" button. Select "Restart" on
         your phone and then reselect "WiFi" from the blocks editor
         connect menu. It should reconnect without you having to enter
         a new code or scan a barcode.
       </p>
       <p>
         This version of App Inventor has new features that will be
         released on the main production server soon. In the meantime
         you may have problems downloading projects from here and then
         uploading them to beta.appinventor.mit.edu because your
         blocks will be too new! This problem should resolve itself in
         a few days when release v129 is out.
